            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of the following <hi>Eſſay</hi> is not to miniſter Fuel to thoſe Impure Flames which have conſum'd ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons, Families, and Nations, but is intended as a <hi>Caveat</hi> and <hi>Warning</hi> to all thoſe who are guilty of that reigning Sin of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> to repent and reform, leſt their Practices bring <hi>as great</hi> or <hi>greater Judgments</hi> upon themſelves, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherein they live, as thoſe they will find here related.</p>
            <p>We have begun at the <hi>Creation,</hi> and trac'd this Sin, from its <hi>original,</hi> thro' all the moſt remarkable Inſtances of it, from <hi>Lamech,</hi> the firſt whom we find upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to have broken the <hi>divine Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> betwixt one Man and one Woman, to the time of <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> the laſt of the <hi>Roman Emperors,</hi> (properly ſo call'd) who died about the Year of
<pb facs="tcp:110363:3"/> Chriſt 476; ſo that, according to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Account, we have run thro' the moſt obſervable Inſtances that happen'd of this nature for the ſpace of 5190 Years.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, we have taken all the Inſtances of the <hi>Old and New Teſtament,</hi> with the Notes of <hi>Commentators</hi> upon the <hi>Crimes</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> and have now and then intermix'd <hi>ſome Obſervations of our own.</hi> It's not doubted but this part will be pleaſant and edifying to all Men of ſober Minds, and may be of great uſe to be put into the Hands of <hi>Youth,</hi> as a <hi>good Monitor</hi> to beware of <hi>Youthful Luſts,</hi> againſt which they will ſee here that GOD hath all-along teſtified ſo much Wrath, and been as good as his Word (if we may make uſe of that familiar Expreſſion) in <hi>puniſhing Whoremongers and Adulterers.</hi> It may be alſo of uſe to confirm and ſtrengthen them againſt the <hi>Blaſphemers</hi> of our Age, who cry down the Divine Authority of the Scriptures, for here they will find Proofs from <hi>Prophane Hiſtory,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> denounced in the Holy Scriptures againſt <hi>Empires, Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs</hi> and other Sins, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fulfill'd; as will appear by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian, Babylonian,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:110363:3"/> 
               <hi>Perſian</hi> Empires, the ſeveral Captivities of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Deſtructions of the Cities of <hi>Babylon, Nineveh,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They will here alſo meet with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s <hi>Character of Whoredom, Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> and <hi>Whores,</hi> collected from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Chapters of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> where he treats of that Sin, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more abominable and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and ſuch as if any Man ſhould give to the <hi>Beaux</hi> and <hi>Debauchees</hi> of this preſent Age, he would run a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being whipp'd through the Lungs, with a <hi>Damn him for a canting foul-mouth'd Coxcomb;</hi> ſo much do thoſe Men hate their own Picture, though drawn to the life by an infallible Hand: And therefore it is no Wonder that they do as much as in them lies to <hi>break the Glaſs which ſhews them their own deformed Aſpect,</hi> that is, cry down the Divine Authority of the Bible, which deſcribes them as graphically as if it had been writ in our own Days.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Rampant Malice</hi> againſt the Goſpel, and the Godhead of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, proceeds from the ſame Cauſe: The divine Lawgiver, by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon his own Text, hath
<pb facs="tcp:110363:4"/> 
               <hi>abridg'd corrupt Mankind of that Liberty which they aſſum'd to themſelves</hi> under the Law, and for which they pleaded Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and hath not only forbid <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy</hi> and <hi>Concubinage,</hi> but declar'd <hi>Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts</hi> to be Criminal, and that <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> No Wonder then that ſuch Perſons as live in open Rebellion to his Dictates, and have bid Defiance to his Threats, do all they can to perſwade themſelves and others, that it is not GOD, but Man, that they fight againſt. It were to be wiſh'd, that moſt of thoſe who embrace and countenance <hi>Deiſm</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> would anſwer from their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, whether a <hi>looſe Converſation,</hi> and Love to an uncontroulable purſuit of their Senſual Pleaſures, did not at firſt beget in them a good Opinion of thoſe newly reviv'd, yet old and ſtinking, <hi>Hereſies:</hi> But whether they do it, or not, it's obſervable enough, that the moſt of their Proſelites in theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſmell rank of <hi>Goatiſh Luſt;</hi> and therefore it's but natural that they ſhould declare War againſt his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, who is to be their Judge at the laſt day, and will aſſign them their
<pb facs="tcp:110363:4"/> Place then on his Left Hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Goats, <hi>if Repentance don't prevent it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And would to God that thoſe Men would but ſeriouſly conſider with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether they have not reaſon to look upon the diſſolute Lives of moſt of their Fraternity, as a juſt Judgment upon them from God, for <hi>growing vain in their Imaginations,</hi> and rejecting all thoſe Principles of Religion which they cannot fathom with their ſhallow and corrupted Reaſon, according to that of the 1ſt of the <hi>Romans, Becauſe they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their Imaginations, their fooliſh Heart was darken'd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools. Wherefore God alſo gave them up to vile Affections and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, thro' the Luſts of their own Hearts to diſhonour their own Bodies;</hi> of which they will meet with dreadful Inſtances in this Treatiſe amongſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> in their <hi>Eleuſina Sacra, Bacchana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, Ludi Florales,</hi> &amp;c. tho' they called themſelves, as indeed they were, the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>moſt polite Nations</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That the denying the Godhead of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to encourage Men in the practice
<pb facs="tcp:110363:5"/> of Uncleanneſs; it may be readily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That ſeeing it was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who recall'd Marriage to its firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and took away that Liberty of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy and Concubinage which the holieſt Men under the Old Teſtament (and ſome of them Prophets too, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid)</hi> thought lawful, the denying of our Saviour's Godhead overthrows his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this and all other things that he hath taught us, inaſmuch as it makes him a Liar; for, that he aſſerted his own God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and was cut off by the <hi>Jews</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf Equal with God, appears plainly from the Hiſtory of that Matter left us by the Evangeliſts: but if it be ſo, that he is not only not God, but died for aſſerting a Lie, that he was ſo, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Practiſe of <hi>Abraham, David, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, &amp;c.</hi> is a better Warrant for Poliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Concubinage than his Word is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Thus it's apparent that the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of Jeſus Chriſt to be God</hi> is introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of Uncleanneſs, eſpecially Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binage, which ſome of our Gallants do ſo much plead for, and will boldly aſſert, that <hi>there's no harm in keeping an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmarried Woman for a Miſs.</hi> And, that the <hi>Socinian</hi> Books, and the Spreaders of that Hereſie, are entertain'd chiefly by Men of ſuch Principles and Practices, is ſo plain, that it cannot well be deny'd.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:110363:5"/>
            <p> To return to our <hi>Account</hi> of <hi>this Work.</hi> We have in the next place taken all thoſe Inſtances in the <hi>celebrated Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that did any way make for our purpoſe. We have likewiſe taken thoſe in <hi>Juſtin, Plutarch</hi>'s Lives, and <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> relating to the <hi>Greeks, Perſians,</hi> and other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by the Ancients, and have turn'd over the <hi>Roman Hiſtories,</hi> from the foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Reign of <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> wherein the Reader will find that this <hi>Sin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs</hi> hath had Tragical Effects upon Empires and Emperors, Monarchies and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, occaſion'd many Revolutions of Government, and that neither the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories of <hi>Alexander, Julius Coeſar,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> nor the great Dignity, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Eſteem, and Princely Qualities of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> the Son of <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> have been able to rub out the Stains which their <hi>impure Luſts</hi> have fixed upon their Memories. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is there any reaſon to think it ſhould, when the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Holineſs of <hi>David,</hi> and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grandeur of <hi>Solomon,</hi> have not been able to ſecure them againſt thoſe Puniſhments which their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Uncleanneſs
<pb facs="tcp:110363:6"/> brought upon their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Families, and Reputations; ſo infallibly true hath it always been found what the Wiſe-man hath fore-told of the <hi>Adulterer,</hi> in the 6th of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> That <hi>a Wound and a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour ſhall he get, and his Reproach ſhall not be wiped away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have alſo look'd into the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtories</hi> of <hi>Euſebius, Socrates, Evagrius,</hi> &amp;c. for ſuch Inſtances as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to our Subject, which we have faithfully ſet down, to ſhew how hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and abominable <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Perſons</hi> were in the Eyes of the <hi>Ancient</hi> Church, what ſevere <hi>Penances</hi> were injoyn'd them, and with how much Difficulty they were receiv'd again into its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>It was deſign'd to have taken a View of the <hi>Hiſtories of all Nations extant,</hi> and, amongſt others, to have inſerted the horrid Inſtances that are to be found in the Lives of the <hi>Popes</hi> and other <hi>Hereſiarchs,</hi> and, in a word, to have brought the <hi>Hiſtory down to our Time,</hi> but finding that the Volume ſwell'd, I thought fit to deferr that to a <hi>Second Eſſay.</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110363:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> uncleanneſs, did precede the <hi>Eating of the forbidden Fruit,</hi> and that as the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſequence of ſuch Antecedents, the firſt thing taken notice of by our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents after the Fall was their <hi>Nakedneſs,</hi> whereof they were immediately aſham'd, and endeavoured to cover it. This <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſs</hi> ſay Commentators that they were ſo ſpeedily made ſenſible of, was not only that they felt their need of a Cover to their Bodies, both for Ornament and Defence againſt the Injuries of the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that they were alſo ſenſible of the <hi>Rebellion of the fleſh,</hi> which doth not only war againſt the Soul, but hath a natural tendency to the diſſolution of the Body, <hi>there being nothing which ſooner extinguiſhes the flame of Life than an immoderate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of that Oyl, which nature hath provided for its nouriſhment.</hi> This impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the affections did no doubt exert it ſelf quickly in actions, which in our firſt Parents could not fall under the notion of <hi>Whoredom,</hi> they being married by God himſelf, in the <hi>State of Innocence;</hi> yet there's little doubt to be made of its having vented it ſelf in an immoderate uſe of the <hi>Marriage bed;</hi> and thus theſe <hi>impure deſires</hi> were communicated to their Poſterity, who were thereby <hi>polluted; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The firſt direct breach of the Divine Inſtitution of Marriage betwixt one Man and one Woman which we find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110363:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> was in the perſon of <hi>Lamch,</hi> one of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Poſterity, whoſe two Wives we find mentioned in the fourth of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> by which it appears plain, that <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Whoredom</hi> are near a kin, had both of 'em their riſe from one and the ſame Family: And according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome Interpreters did both of 'em center in this <hi>Lamech,</hi> who is thought to have been a bloody cruel Man, as is gathered from this diſcourſe to his Wives in that Chapter, <hi>viz. I have ſlain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bad example of <hi>Lamech</hi>'s <hi>digamy,</hi> did quickly infect the Infant World; for we find in the next Chapter, <hi>That when men began to multiply, and that daughters were born unto them, the Sons of God ſaw the Daughters of men, that they were fair and they took them Wives of all that they choſe.</hi> Its ſtill to be obſerved that as Whoredom and Uncleanneſs began in <hi>Cain</hi>'s Family, ſo there it continu'd and increas'd; and by their Contagious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Family of <hi>Seth,</hi> which did then contain the <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> became alſo infected; and the Members of the Church having more regard to the <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Comelineſs</hi> of the Women of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Race, than to the vertue of thoſe who were of their own Religion, <hi>their Eyes betrayed their Hearts,</hi> they luſted after their Beauty, and without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Religion or Laws, took them

               <hi>Noah,</hi> not being able by his preaching of Righteouſneſs, to reform the World from this horrid Debauchery, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd God to bring the Deluge, which drown'd that laſcivious and wicked Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Men, who had drown'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all manner of ſenſual Impurities, with ſo much obſtinacy, that when that <hi>fatal Flood</hi> came it ſurpriz'd them, <hi>as eating, drinking, marrying and giving in marriage.</hi> Thus then it's apparent that Whoredom was one of the principal Cauſes that brought the Wrath of God upon the old World. And it deſerves our obſervation, that God by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Noah</hi> to take only his <hi>own Wife,</hi> and the three Wives of his three Sons into the Ark with him, as he did thereby give another Teſtimony of his honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and approving of Marriage, he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo plainly teſtifie againſt <hi>Digamy, Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Concubines;</hi> and that as the World was peopled at firſt by lawful Marriage, it ſhould be alſo peopled in the ſame manner a ſecond time.</p>

               </gap>ſt inſtance of impurity that occurs to us, is <hi>Ham</hi>'s <hi>deriding his father</hi> Noah'<hi>s nakedneſs,</hi> by which there are ſome Interpreters who underſtand that he not only told it his Brethren, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Women and Children, in a laſcivious and filthy manner, and took occaſion to fall into fooliſh Jeſting and Sarcaſms;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110363:17"/> Nay, if we give credit to the opinion of <hi>Beroſus</hi> and the Rabbins, <hi>he inchanted his Fathers Virile parts,</hi> and unman'd him; but however that is, this is certain, that he diſcover'd a frothy, unclean, laſcivious temper, for which he was ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht in his poſterity The <hi>Canaanites,</hi> who wallowed alſo in thoſe <hi>fleſhly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi> when God deſtroyed them by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the poſterity of <hi>Sem,</hi> as ſhall be taken notice of in its proper place.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Ham</hi> did alſo proceed <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Mighty Hunter and cruel oppreſſor, who was the firſt that laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Tyrannical Government after the Flood, ſo that the obſervation ſtill holds that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Murder and thoſe other Crimes</hi> which lay Nations waſteare near a kin, and generally the off-ſpring and product of one and the ſame Family.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeem'd to have this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appears from his advice given to his beautiful Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> when he travelled with her into <hi>Egypt,</hi> viz. <hi>to ſay ſhe was his Siſter,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed would have kill'd him that they might enjoy her. Whence we may likewiſe obſerve that the Holy Patriarch knew that <hi>luſtful perſons</hi> would rather commit Murder than be baulkt in the ſatisfaction of their Luſts; and yet, tho the World was at that time ſo much degenerated, it's plain from this paſſage, that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:110363:17"/> look'd upon <hi>Marriage as Sacred and Inviolable,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Sarah</hi>'s calling her ſelf <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Siſter could have been no defence of her Husbands life: Nay, it is manifeſt from the Hiſtory that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſign'd to have taken her to Wife, ſo that thoſe Heathen <hi>Egyptians</hi> will riſe up in Judgment againſt our <hi>Chriſtian Debauchees,</hi> who think neither <hi>Fornication nor Adultery</hi> to be Crimes, for it's evident from this paſſage, that both he and his Subjects tho abominably luſtful had a great regard to Marriage, which it's plain he thought neceſſary to render his enjoyment of <hi>Sarah</hi> lawfull.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral other things to be learned from this remarkable inſtance, as that the <hi>vanity of matching with none but thoſe of Royal Extract had not then invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Thrones of Princes</hi>—But at the ſame time it is as plain that it hath been an old and wicked Cuſtom amongſt Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and Nobles to be Panders to the luſts of their Monarchs, for here we find that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Princes Commended <hi>Sarah</hi>'s <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to him, which occaſioned her being taken into his Houſe; and would to God that no ſuch thing had ever been juſtly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon the <hi>Court of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are only two Remarks more which I have to make on this Story, and ſhall then proceed to another, <hi>viz.</hi> that God by ſmiting <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Houſe-hold, all of ſudden with Plagues, did
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110363:18"/> both give a Teſtimony of his divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt ſuch <hi>luſtful practices,</hi> and of <hi>his being a protector of Conjugal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the nature of this Plague infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his houſhold was is not agreed upon amongſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters. The Hebrews ſay, that it was a <hi>Gonorrhoea or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer in his ſecret parts,</hi> which prevented his deſign: <hi>Joſephus</hi> thinks it was a Peſtilence and ſudden Sedition in the Palace; <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> ſays it was a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per both of Body and Mind, and <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,</hi> is of opinion that it was ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Plague inflicted upon him, juſt as <hi>Sarah was brought to his Bed;</hi> but however thoſe things be, this is certain, that <hi>Sarah</hi>'s pollution was prevented, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> oblig'd to own that it was not lawful to take another Man's Wife.</p>
            <p>The next inſtance is of <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is the firſt of the Poſterity of <hi>Seth</hi> after the Flood, that we find to have been guilty of <hi>Digamy;</hi> it's plain that the occaſion of his taking his Handmaid <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> to Wife, was his <hi>VVife Sarah's advice,</hi> and the Cauſe of her giving that advice, was her own <hi>Barrenneſs,</hi> advanced age, and fear that ſhe ſhould not otherwiſe have the promiſed Seed. The Cauſes of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s conſenting ſo eaſily were no doubt the ſame, and <hi>Polygamy</hi> being then Common in the World, his Practice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred no occaſion of Scandal, ſo that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110363:18"/> his practice of <hi>marrying his Maid in thoſe times of Ignorance which God wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at,</hi> can not afford any argument for <hi>Polygamy</hi> now, and ſeeing he had his Wife's conſent, it will far leſs warrant thoſe <hi>laſcivious Intrigues which many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have now a days with their Maid-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> But that this practice of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Patriarch was diſpleaſing to God will eaſily appear from the puniſhment infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon his Family, the Peace of which was immediately broke, by <hi>Hagar's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing her Miſtreſs, aſſoon as ſhe found her ſelf pregnant with the promiſed Seed as ſhe vainly believ'd: Then <hi>Sarah</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids <hi>Abraham</hi> with the wrong where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe her ſelf was the occaſion, and forc'd him to a breach of that Marriage Bond, which by her own advice he had contracted: <hi>Hagar</hi> was alſo puniſht for her unlawful Conſent, firſt, by being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely dealt with by <hi>Sarah,</hi> who gave her for a Wife to her Husband, and then by being thruſt out of the Family and expos'd to the World, and though ſhe was brought back again for ſome, time till ſhe was delivered of her Son, <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> yet her abode was of no long continuance, for ſhe was thruſt out again with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional affliction, that ſhe had her Son to provide for, was expos'd to the cruel neceſſity of ſeeing him die of thirſt as ſhe apprehended, and inſtead of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>promiſed Seed,</hi> ſhe and he were both
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110363:19"/> Ignominiouſly thruſt out from partaking of the Inheritance with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſhe was plainly told from Heaven, that he ſhould be a wild Man, <hi>having his hand againſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, and every Man's hand againſt him;</hi> which was ſpeedily verified, for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a profane ſcoffer at Religion and the promiſe of God, which occaſioned his expulſion from his Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Family and the Church.

            <p>Nor is it fit we ſhould paſs over what is commonly obſerv'd by Divines, that the very Ordinance of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> by which the fore-skin was appointed to be cut off, was a mark of God's diſpleaſure at <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence upon the Inſtrument of Generation;</hi> and likewiſe an evidence that thoſe who expect his favour ſhould mortifie that Corruption; and that it only took place upon <hi>Males,</hi> was becauſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Generation and conſequently of natural Corruption is from that Sex.</p>
            <p>The next dreadful Inſtance of God's hatred and indignation at <hi>VVhoredom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> is his raining of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone upon <hi>Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim,</hi> &amp;c. the cry of their lewdneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, that it ſeemed to drown the noiſe of all other Sins at that time.

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:110363:20"/> Nor is it unlikely that the Comely and Beautiful aſpect of thoſe Angels added fewel to their flames, and it deſerves particular obſervation, that the <hi>whole City both old and young was infected with this luſtful Contagion,</hi> in which they were ſo hardened, that neither <hi>Lot</hi>'s unadviſed propoſal of his own Daughters (to them) who were more natural and fit Objects for their Luſt; nor the remarkable Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon them in ſtriking them with blindneſs were able to divert them from their deviliſh purpoſe, of offering that <hi>unnatural abuſe</hi> to thoſe Meſſengers of God, who at laſt after having ſet <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family out of danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the executioners of Divine Juſtice upon thoſe Monſters of Impurity, and puniſht their <hi>luſtful flames</hi> with ſtorms of Fire and Brimſtone, which were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome precurſory drops to thoſe ſhowers of everlaſting fire, which <hi>makes the ſmoak of their torments to aſcend for ever and ever.</hi>

            <p>Neither ought it to paſs without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that God did not only puniſh themſelves, but would have their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which they had polluted to remain a Monument of their abominable Impurity, and his juſt Judgment, ſo long as the world ſtands: nor would Divine Juſtice ſuffer <hi>Lot's VVife to paſs unpuniſh'd for looking back upon the place</hi> which ſhe left with a reluctancy, and could have wiſht

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110363:24"/> are ſome who think that this Polygamy of the Patriarchs was by a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, and particular Diſpenſation, and therefore as in that caſe it could not be blamable, neither can it now be ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imitable, the chief Reaſons they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, for their opinions are, that it was permitted for the Increaſing of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Seed,</hi> that Jacob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Wives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were acted by more than a Natural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and <hi>much ſelf-denial, in recommending their Maids to their Husband's Bed,</hi> which in ordinary Caſes muſt be ſuppoſed to alienate his Affection from themſelves. In the next place they obſerve that they pray'd for off-ſpring by their Maids and brought up their Children upon their own knees. It muſt be own'd that thoſe things were Extraordinary and Contrary to the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Principle of the generality of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> yet it's ſtrongly preſumable, that there was ſomething of Cuſtom as wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as of Inſtinct in this matter, and that the people of God were polluted with the bad Example of thoſe amongſt whom they lived.</p>
            <p>But however theſe things were, this is certain that all the Perſons concerned were one way or other puniſh'd for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in this Affair. <hi>Laban</hi> had not only the mortification to ſee his two Daughters Jarr and Diſagree, and Envy one another, but alſo to find his Riches and Subſtance decreaſe and to be conveighed to another hand; <hi>Leah,</hi> ſhe was ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110363:24"/> by finding that ſhe had leſs of her Husband's Love than her Siſter, whoſe Bed ſhe had unjuſtly defiled. <hi>Rachel</hi> was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with barrenneſs for ſome time for conſenting to live with <hi>Jacob</hi> as his Wife, when ſhe knew that her Father had given her eldeſt Siſter into his Bed. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s life was very uneaſy betwixt his <hi>Jarring Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, who did each of them Envy the others En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him;</hi> Nay, he was perfectly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Command of his Imperious and Beautiful <hi>Rachel,</hi> and obliged to take a <hi>third Wife to beget Children for her,</hi> and this laid him under a neceſſity of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Leah</hi> in the like manner, which as it muſt needs Conſume his Body he being now above 80 years of age, there was no doubt but it increaſed his care how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for ſo many Wives and Children, at the ſame time he was alſo plagued with a Covetous Oppreſſing Father-in-Law, and diſcontented Brethren who envied his growing rich in the World.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be doubted but there was frequent Quarrels amongſt the <hi>Children of ſo many different Mothers,</hi> ſeeing it's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to find Children by the ſame Father and Mother often to diſagree, and this without doubt begot mutual Broils, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and Heats amongſt <hi>the different Wives</hi> every one envying the proſperity or good Fortune of anothers Children. An Inſtance of this we have in <hi>Rachel</hi> who was ſo much taken with <hi>Reuben</hi>'s <hi>Mandrakes</hi> that there's no doubt but ſhe could have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110363:25"/> wish'd they had been found by one of her own Sons. Hence alſo we may obſerve, <hi>That as the Children did every one love their own Mothers beſt, it muſt needs occaſion Quarrels amongſt them.</hi> It's not agreed among In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters what theſe Mandrakes were, ſome will have them to be <hi>Beautiful Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Flowers,</hi> and others, that they were Beautiful and Delicious Apples which <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted Conception,</hi> and that therefore they were ſo much deſired by <hi>Rachel,</hi> which, if it were ſo, she was however diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for having agreed that her Husband ſhould be with <hi>Leah</hi> that night, it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned her Rival to have two Sons Succeſſively one after another, and alſo one Daughter. But as to the Mandrakes themſelves, <hi>St. Auguſtine againſt Fauſtus</hi> tells us, <hi>That he has ſeen of 'em, Diligently In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into their Nature, and ſays, they were Apples fine to the Eye, and of a ſweet Scent, but inſipid taſte, but very rare to be had, and on that Account alone he thought</hi> Rachel <hi>did Covet them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſin of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> is alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry legible in their puniſhment, by the foul Crimes of their Children <hi>Reuben and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah. Jacob</hi> was guilty of Inceſt with two Siſters, and to the great grief of his Soul, eternal Reproach of his Family, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the Neighbouring Heathen; his Son <hi>Reuben</hi> committed Inceſt with his own <hi>Concubine Bilhah,</hi> which by the way, was another puniſhment upon her for conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Marry one who had <hi>two Wives</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110363:25"/> and whom ſhe had no reaſon to think could ever be able to perform Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal duty to ſo many, and 'tis not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this made her an eaſy prey to the Tentation.—Then as to <hi>Dinah,</hi> her being polluted by <hi>Schechem</hi> the Son of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> was another diſgrace to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and brought a freſh ſcandal upon the Church, as well as ruin upon the <hi>Scheche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> whoſe deſtruction was occaſioned by the <hi>Luſtful Paſſion</hi> of their Prince, in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Daughter as with an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, which ſo enraged her Brethren that by a fraudulent Covenant they obliged the <hi>Schechemites</hi> to Circumciſe themſelves, came upon them while they were Sore, and put all the Males to the Sword—And thus <hi>Dinah</hi> was alſo puniſhed for her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the Daughters of the Land, who were Idolaters and of corrupt manners; her Curioſity which is ſo <hi>common to young Maids</hi> was fatal to her ſelf and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, neither is there any thing better to be expected from thoſe <hi>Profane Feſtivals, Revellings and Banquetings,</hi> which <hi>Joſephus</hi> thinks the <hi>Schechemites</hi> were now taken up with:—And that <hi>Dinah</hi> either having ſtole away from her Mother to ſee how the Daughters of the Land were adorn'd, and behav'd themſelves in their publick Dances, or being ſo far indulged as to have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to go, the <hi>Libidinous young Prince</hi> being taken with her Beauty, and under no reſtraint, but dandled by an Indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>violated her Chaſtity,</hi> for which himſelf,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110363:26"/> his Son, and all their Male Subjects quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after loſt their Lives, having firſt been by the Juſt Judgment of God puniſh'd in the <hi>very Inſtrument of their Laſciviouſneſs.</hi> The wound as it's uſual putting them to great pain, and making them unable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reſiſt or fly from <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Armed Sons and Servants; and thus alſo the Good Old Man was puniſh'd by the Rape of his only Daughter, and his bleeding wound ript open afresh by the Treachery and Cruelty of his Children. This is another Inſtance of a People cut off and deſtroyed for Uncleanneſs</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next thing</hi> that occurrs, is another affliction to the <hi>Good Old Patriarch,</hi> from the Evil Report of the Sons of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines <hi>Zilpah</hi> and <hi>Bilhah,</hi> who being the off-ſpring of an Unlawful Marriage were alſo of a Lewd Converſation themſelves, and according to the opinion of ſome of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> guilty of <hi>Sodomitical Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> But however, that was, this is plain from the Sacred Text, that they had an ill ſame, and with this <hi>Joſeph</hi> acquainted his Father, which occaſioned their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to kill <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and at laſt to ſell him, ſo that here <hi>Jacob</hi> was remarkably puniſh'd for his Polygamy; The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe Concubines being both wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and haters of his Children by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wedlock; and tho it be not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our purpoſe yet it may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unpleaſant to the Reader to acquaint him that the <hi>Hebrews think</hi> Jacob <hi>was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110363:26"/> puniſh'd, when made to believe that the blood of a Kid was that of his Son</hi> Joſeph, <hi>becauſe he had formerly deceived his Father and made him to believe that he was his eldeſt Son</hi> Eſau, <hi>by putting a Kid's Skin about his Neck,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Our next Inſtance is in <hi>Judah,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left his Brethren and his Father's Houſe, and by Conſequence the then Church, and Lodging with an <hi>Adulamite, fell in Love with a Canaanitiſh Woman,</hi> and Married her (he not then exceeding 14 Years of Age himſelf as Chronologers think) not only without his Father's Conſent, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, according to the Example of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau.</hi>—How he was puniſh'd for this fault the following Hiſtory acquaints us, <hi>viz.</hi> That having obliged his Son <hi>Er</hi> to an early and precipitant Marriage like his own, who being a Wicked Man, and as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> think, guilty of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> or as others of ſpilling his Seed upon the ground as his Brother <hi>Onan</hi> did, the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him. Nor was <hi>Judah</hi> any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier in his Son <hi>Onan</hi> abovementioned, who being given to his Brother's Widow for a Husband to <hi>raiſe up Seed to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> did maliciouſly ſpill it on the ground, that his Brother's Memory might not be continued; Whereas to die Childleſs had not only a Tendency to the decay, and ruin of the Family, but was alſo look'd upon as Reproachful, and therefore it is the opinion of Divines, that that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Law was conſtituted <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 5. The
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110363:27"/> 
               <hi>Rabbins</hi> according to their fabulous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, alledge, That <hi>Onan</hi> did this becauſe he would not have <hi>Thamar</hi>'s Beauty ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by bearing Children, but whatever truth there be in that, 'tis certain that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him for <hi>that Impurity, and fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the End of Nature, which is next akin to Murther if not a ſpecies of it, ſeeing it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed that which was potentially a Man or Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Judah</hi>'s puniſhment does not ceaſe here, he is plagued with raging Luſt in his own advanced years, and being a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower did inceſtuouſly pollute his own Daughter-in Law <hi>Thoemar,</hi> whom he took to be a Common Harlot, by which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd a perpetual diſgrace, and brought an Indelible blot upon his Memory. From that Hiſtory we may plainly alſo perceive that Adultery was held a Capital Crime even amongſt thoſe <hi>Canaanites,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Judah</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Daughter-in-Law who was in a manner betrothed to his third Son <hi>Shelah</hi> to be burnt: Nay, and that the Crime which is called <hi>ſimple Fornication</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſhamefull amongſt them, ſeeing, when he ſent his Friend to redeem the pledges which he had left with <hi>Thamar,</hi> but could neither find her nor them, he ſaid, <hi>Let her take them to her, leſt we be aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Thamar's</hi> fact ſome have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to excuſe, becauſe ſay they, It did not proceed from <hi>Incontinence,</hi> but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her-ſelf upon her Father, for not giving her <hi>Shelah</hi> to Husband as he had
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110363:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> promiſed; and others alledge that ſhe had ſome knowledge that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from <hi>Judah,</hi> and therefore deſired to be impregnated by him, but neither of theſe Excuſes are ſufficient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find that ſhe was puniſh'd with a <hi>perpetual Widowhood</hi> for her Incontinence; and alſo by a dangerous and monſtrous Birth of twins, who ſeemed to ſtrive which of them ſhould be ſooneſt rid of their <hi>Impure Mother,</hi> and by that means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to render the Memory of their Father and Mother's Crime immortal.</p>
            <p>The next Scripture Inſtance is of a mixt Nature, and contains a <hi>Glorious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Chaſtity in the Perſon of</hi> Joſeph, againſt the Tentations of his Laſcivious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, by embracing of which, he might not only have ſatisfied the juvenile heat of Concupiſcence, but alſo have expected <hi>Riches, Preferment,</hi> and what not by means of a <hi>Woman of her Quality,</hi> and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to fulfil the Luſts of the Fleſh with Secrecy and Impunity, the Repeated attacks which ſhe made upon him, his <hi>abſence and unjuſt Expulſion</hi> from his Father's Family, which then contain'd the viſible Church, the Impure Example of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the unavoidable danger which he muſt needs foreſee he threw himſelf into, by reſiſting her Unlawful deſires, ſet his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory off with the <hi>greater Luſtre,</hi> and depaints her Crime in Blacker Colours; and that ſame Hiſtory which rewards his Chaſtity with immortal Fame, <hi>puniſhes her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:110363:28"/> with eternal diſgrace, and Brands her with a ſort of <hi>Rape contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Courſe of the Sex,</hi> and with abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gruelty in accuſing the Innocent youth of her own Crime, for which he was ſhut up in Priſon and brought in danger of his Life; ſuch is the <hi>Rage of diſappointed Luſt.</hi> The <hi>Rabbins</hi> alledge that ſhe feigned her ſelf to be ſick, or really might be ſo thro' her <hi>burning Luſt</hi> as <hi>Amnon</hi> was for <hi>Tamar,</hi> and finding that all her Sollicitations by words could not do, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it ſo as he ſhould find her a Bed in a Room where he frequented, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to <hi>add Strength to the Tentation,</hi> and if that would not do, was reſolved to make uſe of Force, which ſhe did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo attempt, but in vain. And it is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that her Husband, tho' no doubt incens'd upon her accuſing <hi>Joſeph,</hi> yet was ſo far over-rul'd as to abſtain from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards him, and 'tis not at all to be doubted, but when <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Favour</hi> in the Court of Heaven, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him to the Court of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but this Unchaſte Woman, if then alive, became a Curſe and a Reproach, or if dead that her memory became Vile and Contemptible. This paſſage brings naturally to my mind that well known Reflection upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation here in <hi>England,</hi> by ſome looſe Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> That it came from <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's <hi>Codpiece,</hi> which opprobrious ſaying, was probably invented by Enemies to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and as there's no doubt but that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110363:28"/> Prince's Incontinence gave him occaſion to Enquire into the Pope's Power, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to break it when he oppos'd his divorce, ſo we ſee it is no new thing for God to bring about his own holy and pure deſigns, by the Impure and Wicked deſigns of Mortals, for here this <hi>Woman</hi>'s <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence</hi> occaſion'd <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Impriſonment, where becoming acquainted with ſome of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Courtiers then under diſgrace, that gave occaſion to his being ſent for to Court, and laid the Foundation of that Deliverance which the <hi>Church of God</hi> had from an Univerſal <hi>Famine</hi> by his means.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph</hi> with one obſervation, that as he is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to poſterity for a <hi>Mirror of Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> we don't find that he was ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with <hi>digamy or polygamy,</hi> as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Great Grand-Father were, whoſe Examples herein, tho' they were Holy men, he never followed, and this is the more Remarkable becauſe his Dignity and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> furniſh'd him with all things neceſſary for <hi>Pampering the Fleſh,</hi> and afforded him an opportunity of keeping as many Wives and Concubines as he pleaſed, and yet we find he contented himſelf with one, by which alſo we may perceive that tho' a Pattern of Chaſtity, yet he accounted Lawfull Marriage and Procreation of Children no violation of it, as the <hi>Mad Popiſh Monks</hi> would pretend to do.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:110363:29"/>
            <p> The next Inſtance we have of Divine Judgment upon Uncleanneſs is in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted upon <hi>Reuben,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically foretold by his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> in his laſt words unto his Children, or in his laſt Will and Teſtament as ſome are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call it. The Judgment pronounced againſt <hi>Reuben</hi> is this, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nstable as Water thou ſhalt not excell becauſe thou wenteſt up to thy Father's Bed, then defiled'ſt thou it, he went up to my Couch,</hi> &amp;c. Chronologers Reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this was 40 years after <hi>Reuben</hi>'s Inceſt with his Father's Concubine <hi>Bilhah,</hi> and tho' <hi>Reuben</hi> had no doubt repented of his Crime and was thereupon pardon'd by God and his Father ſo as to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in the Church and in his Father's Family, yet now his iniquity is called to remembrance by his dying Parent, who puts <hi>Reuben</hi> to ſhame afreſh before all his Brethren, and declares it to be the Will of God, that <hi>Reuben</hi> ſhould be deprived of his Birth-right becauſe of his Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that whereas being the Eldeſt Son he ought of right to have expected <hi>the Prieſthood, Royalty, and Preeminence over his Brethren;</hi> he is now told that he <hi>ſhould not excell,</hi> that is, he and his Poſterity ſhould neither be conſiderable for <hi>Strength, Valour, nor Number,</hi> and the cauſe is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned becauſe he was Unſtable as Water and had defiled his Father's Bed, or had been acted by his Impetuous and Raging Luſt like an inundation of Water which over-flows its Banks and drowns, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110363:29"/> and thus as <hi>Eſau</hi> loſt his Birth-right by one ſort of Profanity, <hi>Reuben</hi> loſt it by another; and as he had reſembled an Inundation of Water for Fury and Inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſo God poured him out like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and made his ſtate Unſtable; and this Judgment was pronounced in the hearing, of all his Brethren as the laſt and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable Will of God and his Father; which, there's no reaſon to doubt, ſet it home with the greater pungency upon <hi>Reuben</hi>'s Soul; and eſpecially becauſe not only he himſelf, but his Poſterity alſo was ſet up as a Monument of God's Judgment againſt Incontinence. There are ſome who fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly aſſert, that <hi>Jacob</hi> being well vers'd in Aſtronomy, did read the deſtiny of his Sons in the Stars, where they will have the prognoſtication of all humane E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents to be writ down as in a Book; but the Event hath verified that he was acted by a more infallible Author.</p>
            <p>The next thing that offers it ſelf to our Conſideration is the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd againſt <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who were Brethren to <hi>Reuben</hi> by <hi>Leah,</hi> joyned to <hi>Jacob</hi> as hath been formerly obſerved by Unlawfull Wedlock.—And that which makes the Curſe inflicted upon them fit for our Remark is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was occaſioned by their Cruelty againſt the <hi>Schechemites,</hi> of which the Rape committed upon their Siſter <hi>Dinah</hi> was the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Cauſe; ſo that it comes naturally to be taken notice of as one of the Judgments
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110363:30"/> which was the Conſequence of Luſt. The purport of their Sentence was, <hi>That they ſhould be divided in</hi> Jacob <hi>and diſperſed in</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. A very proper puniſhment for thoſe who commit Crimes againſt the being of humane Society, to be ſcattered up and down upon the face of the Earth: And if we may give Credit to the Conjectures of the Learned, their Poſterity inherited their Father's Cruelty; for the <hi>Levites,</hi> that is to ſay, the order of Prieſthood, and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of <hi>Levi,</hi> condemned Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>Judas</hi> who betray'd him, being as they ſay, of the Tribe of <hi>Simeon,</hi> both thoſe Tribes had a hand in that Condemnation, which was the moſt cruel and unjuſt Sentence that ever was pronounced in the World.</p>
            <p>The next thing which we find in the Sacred Records relating to our Subject is, That God to Teſtify his abhorrence of this ſin of Uncleanneſs, gives it as the 7th. precept to his peculiar People, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould not commit Adultery; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Term, Uncleanneſs of every ſort is forbidden; and being the 7th. in order it would ſeem that the Divine Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver did thereby intimate that they ſhould be as frequent and particular in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this precept as they were to be of ſanctifying every Seventh Day, which tho it were appointed for a reſt, yet they were hereby given to underſtand that they were not to ſpend this Day in Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Wantonneſs, nor make it the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Day of their impure Aſſignations as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110363:30"/> our Modern Debauchees do; and tho' this precept was promulgated from Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> with the ſame ſolemnity of Thunder and Lightning as the reſt of the Law was, yet God would have his people ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in the obſervation of it, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a further ſanction to it, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular puniſhments for the various manners of breaking it: as he that enticed and deſil'd <hi>Virgin</hi> ſhould certainly take her to Wife; but if her Father would not conſent to it, the Perſon that deſiled her ſhould pay her Doury; but if the <hi>Virgin</hi> were betrothed and deſiled in any place where ſhe might have help upon crying out, then both Parties were to be put to death; but if the betrothed <hi>Virgin</hi> were ſurprized in the field, or where ſhe could not have help upon crying out, then the Man was only to ſuffer death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22, 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. <hi>from</hi> 14 <hi>to the end,</hi> but in caſe any Man were found lying with another Man's Wife, then both the offending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were to be ſtoned to Death; and if any Husband could prove that his Wife had plaid the Whore with another Man before his Marriage to her, ſhe was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be ſtoned to death.—And as a further Evidence of God's deteſtation of Whoredom, it was appointed <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 2. <hi>That no Baſtard ſhould enter into the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Lord, even to his tenth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> Nay, ſo great was the care of the Divine Law-giver to have his ſelect Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtrictly Chaſte and Continent, that he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110363:31"/> orders them to provide againſt all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Laſciviouſneſs, or Incontinence in their very Apparel, and particularly in the 22. of <hi>Deut.</hi> and 12. he commands them to make Fringes upon the four Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their Garments, which ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators underſtand to be Points or Laces to faſten them ſo that their <hi>Nakedneſs</hi> might not be diſcovered on any occaſion, <hi>Breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es not being then in uſe.</hi> In that ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Men are forbid to wear Women's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, or Women Men's, leſt thereby there ſhould be an opportunity given to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Luſts.

            <p>It is alſo worth our Notice, that the Explanation of this <hi>Seventh Commandment</hi> is more at large ſet down in the Sacred Scriptures, than that of any other of the Commandments, and that the Law-giver knowing the Frailty of humane Nature, hath been particularly Carefull and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant in the methods appointed for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Chaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110363:32"/> methods for diſcovering and puniſhing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence.</p>
            <p>The Liberty allow'd the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their divorces and the privilege that a new Married Man had of not being obliged to go to War the firſt year, are ſufficient proofs of the Lenity of the Law-giver, and that no Perſon could pretend any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſiable reaſon for their <hi>Incontinence.</hi> A year's time for a Man and a Woman to cohabit was ſufficient to eſtabliſh their mutual Love, and to prevent that Lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the fleſh which is diſcoverable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on firſt Marriage, and might endanger the Woman's Chaſtity if too ſoon deprived of her Husband, and the Man's alſo if all of a ſudden taken from his Wife, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to follow a Military Employment, which generally abounds with Tentations to Incontinence, and many other Crimes—And anſwerable to this is the Command of the Apoſtle, <hi>That the Husband ſhould pay all due benevolence to the Wife, and that they ſhould not defrand one another but with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for a time, leſt Satan tempt them for their Incontinence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chaſtity was ſo ſtrictly enjoyned unto this ſelect people of God, that they were not only forbid to ſuffer any of their Daughters to be Whores, or any of their Sons to be Whore-Maſters, as ſome think the word which in our Tranſlation <hi>Deut</hi> 23. 17. is <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> ought to be rendered, but all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of immodeſty was ſtrictly forbid; and therefore if any Woman ſeeing her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110363:32"/> and another Man a Quarrelling, ſhould be ſo impudent in her Fury or Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to take the other Man by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Parts</hi> to oblige him to forbear Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with her Husband, her hand was to be cut off without any pity, tho' eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man knows that a Preſſure or Gripe in thoſe parts would quickly Force her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Antagoniſt to quit the Fray.—And by much more reaſon would thoſe Judges have Condemned Women who put their hands to thoſe parts upon a <hi>Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trials appointed in the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> to find out whether the Jealouſie of the Husband was well founded, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe admirably Accommodated for the Clearing of the Innocent, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Guilty. The <hi>Tokens of Virginity</hi> which the Learned tell us never failed in that Climate, were a Convincing proof of the Brides being a Maid or otherwiſe, and therefore the Linen in which the Bridegroom and ſhe lay the <hi>firſt night</hi> was carefully kept by the Parents of the Bride, and taken from the Bed before proper Witneſſes, as a ſecurity for their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Honour. If the accuſation were found falſe, the Husband was to be Chaſtis'd and Fin'd in an Hundred Shekels of Silver to the Father of the Damſel, and if it was found to be true, ſhe was to be ſtoned to Death for having wrought folly in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo that there's no doubt but this Cuſtom had a mighty influence upon Parents to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110363:33"/> watch carefully over their Daughters, and on the <hi>Virgius</hi> themſelves to preſerve their Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>The Trial to find out whether a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had committed <hi>Adultery</hi> after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was yet more ſolemn and terrible, as may be ſeen in the 5th. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> from the 11th. to the 31ſt. Verſe. And ſeeing the effect of the bitter Water which the Woman was to drink on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was altogether Supernatural, <hi>viz.</hi> to make her fruitful if Innocent, and her Belly to ſwell and Thigh to rot if guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it plainly demonſtrated that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the <hi>Patron of Chaſtity, and Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Adultery,</hi> and the Perſon found guilty upon this occaſion becoming a curſe among the people, it ſhews how odious and abominable that Crime then was in the Eyes of Man as well as in the Eyes of God; and there's no doubt but this had a very great influence upon Women to be <hi>Loyal to their Husbands,</hi> and careful to avoid giving 'em any occaſion of Jealouſie. It's probable that the <hi>Trial of Adultery</hi> by the Fiery <hi>ordeal,</hi> or laying ſo many hot Bars of Iron upon the ground, covering the Woman's Eyes, and making her go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them with her bare Feet, which ſhe burnt if Guilty, and came off without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurt if Innocent, was an Apiſh I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of this ſolemn and ſevere <hi>Jewiſh Trial,</hi> as many other of the Popiſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions are fooliſh and unwarrantable Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies; but as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110363:33"/> they have not the Divine Inſtitution for their Warrant, they come always ſhort of the deſired effect, and turn to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Inventers and Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>It alſo deſerves our obſervation that the flux of the Natural Seed in Man, the menſtrua in Women, and their ordinary purgations after Child-bearing, rendred them unfit for publick worſhip, and were accounted unclean. Nay even the very Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Act betwixt Man and Wife went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that denomination; becauſe; as it is well obſerved by Divines, <q>the Corruption of Nature is more apt to diſcover it ſelf in that Lawfull act, than perhaps in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and becauſe Original Corruption is Conveyed unto us in our firſt Conception by that very ſubſtance whereof we are made.</q>

            <p>The next ſcriptural Inſtance that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, is in the 25th. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where we have an account that the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Midianites</hi> being afraid of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the King of the <hi>Moabites</hi> ſent for <hi>Balaam,</hi> a falſe Prophet and Enchanter, to Curſe them, that he might the more eaſily prevail over them; but <hi>Balaam</hi> finding that it was not in his power to Curſe thoſe whom God had Bleſſed, gave them advice to ſend out their <hi>Beautiful Women</hi> among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to tempt them to Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which if they could, he knew that it would render them odious in the ſight of their Holy God, and bring down Judgments

We muſt take notice by the way, that the <hi>Moabites</hi> were the Deſcendants of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Inceſtuous Brood by one of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and 'tis very probable that they lookt upon <hi>promiſcuous Copulations</hi> to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Authoriz'd by the unhappy ſlip of that Good man, which together with their Zeal to ſave their Country, made them ready enough to proſtitute themſelves to the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites—</hi>And they notwithſtanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition and Laws of that God who had choſen them for his peculiar people, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them his firſt born, deſtroyed the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and <hi>Amorites</hi> for their ſakes, and as he told them himſelf, becauſe of ſuch pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, yet they, whom <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Magick could not Enchant, were ſo much bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Luſt</hi> towards the Daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> that they firſt committed Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with them, and then committed I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry to pleaſe them; ſo eaſie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is <hi>the tranſition from a wicked Life to a falſe Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Lewd and Ungratefull Practice did quickly kindle the Anger of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, which was no other way to be expiated but by the Death of thoſe who had been <hi>Ring-Leaders of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Idolatry,</hi> and therefore God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Judges and Magiſtrates by the Mouth of his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> every one to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110363:34"/> ſlay thoſe Ring-Leaders and Heads of the people in their own Juriſdiction, who had polluted themſelves, and to hang them up againſt the Sun, in the face of which they had committed theſe Abominations; ſo that a <hi>Thouſand</hi> of thoſe profane Great men were hanged, as the Learned do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and <hi>Twenty Three Thouſand of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people</hi> were conſumed by the Plague for their Whoredom.</p>
            <p>In this General Inſtance of Uncleanneſs there is one more particularly taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> a Prince of the Tribe of <hi>Simeon,</hi> with <hi>Cozbi</hi> the Daughter of a Prince of <hi>Midian.</hi> By the reading it would ſeem that this man was ſo far beſotted with his <hi>Luſtfull Paſſion,</hi> as neither to regard the Command of God for hanging up other Great men that were guilty of the like Crime, nor the hand of God which was gone out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Common People, deſtroying thoſe by a burning Plague who juſt before were burning in their Luſts, but in the very heat of God's Anger, and while the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation were all in Tears for their Sins and Judgments, as if he would out brave the wrath of God and inſult over the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people, he brought his <hi>Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antiſh Whore</hi> in the ſight of <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Congregation into his Tent, and as he made himſelf thus a <hi>Remarkable Sinner,</hi> the Lord did purſue him with as Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Judgment, by ſturring up <hi>Phinehas</hi> to go beyond the ordinary bounds of his

            <p>The horrid advice of <hi>Balaam</hi> before mentioned puts me in mind of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> is generally charged with as to <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>That the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110363:35"/> beſt way to make us Papiſts, was, to debauch our Morals, particularly by Whoredom.</hi> We find by the Inſtance juſt now related, that Uncleanneſs is a ſtrong attractive to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and whether the Lewd Example of the Court which overſpread the Nation with Debauchery, did not very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the <hi>Popiſh Intereſt</hi> in former Reigns, and likewiſe lay the Foundation for that <hi>Atheiſm, Deiſm,</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> which doth ſo much abound in this (now that the Debauchees cannot find their Account in Popery) let Experience teſtify.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Advocates of Lechery</hi> ſhould object, that the puniſhments abovementioned were inflicted upon the People becauſe of their Idolatry, and not upon the Account of their Infamous Commerce with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Midian;</hi> it is eaſie to anſwer them that they were puniſh'd for both in Conjunction; and the Apoſtle in the firſt of <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 10. and 8. aſſigns their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> as the Cauſe of their Judgments; it being indeed the Original Cauſe, and as has been ſaid already, Whoredom and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry have a Natural Tendency to one another, and therefore Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Receipt abovementioned for perverting Proteſtants to be Papiſts, may very well paſs with a <hi>probatumeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There's one thing more to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in this Inſtance, and that is, the Judgments which this Whoredom brought upon the <hi>Midianites</hi> as well as upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It is well enough known
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110363:36"/> that Corrupt Nature is prone enough to Revenge, and there's little reaſon to doubt but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were incens'd enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe of <hi>Midian</hi> for this Great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury they had done them, yet the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thought fit to whett their Revenge and Commanded them <hi>to Vex the</hi> Midianites <hi>and Smite them, becauſe they vexed them with their Wiles, and beguil'd them in the matter of</hi> Peor <hi>and</hi> Cozbi, that is by enticing them to Idolatry and Whoredom, <hi>Peor</hi> being the Mountain where the <hi>Midianitiſh Baal</hi> was worſhipped, for <hi>Baal</hi> was an Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Name to Heathen Idols, as <hi>Mary</hi> is to the Popiſh ones, but diſtinguiſh'd by the places where the moſt Famous Statues or Pictures of 'em were worſhiped, as our Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> Lady of <hi>Prague, &amp;c.</hi> now a days.</p>
            <p>So that here's a War declared againſt <hi>Midian</hi> with as good Authority and for as great and weighty Cauſes as ever any War was declared under Heav'n.</p>
            <p>The Execution of which we have an account of in the 31. Chap. where it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended unto <hi>Moſes</hi> as the laſt Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Exploit that ever he was to perform to Avenge the Lord and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly done by an Army Contemptible for Number, <hi>viz.</hi> 12000 Men, who deſtroyed a Numerous People, Governed by 5 Kings, put all their Males to the edge of the Sword, their Kings not excepted, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſe Prophet
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110363:36"/> was ſlain as a juſt reward for his pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Council, and ſo the Riches which he acquir'd and was ſo covetous of, that for the Lucre of 'em he would act contrary to God's Expreſs Command, became a prey to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt whom he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch Helliſh advice.</p>
            <p>It is alſo obſervable that <hi>Phinehas</hi> who had formerly ſignalized his Zeal, is ſent along with the Troops, which was both a great Honour to him and an Encouragement to them as fighting under the Auſpices of Heaven, and had it been otherwiſe they could never poſſibly have Conquer'd ſuch a great People as the <hi>Midianites</hi> appear to have been 3 by the Number of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſaved that had never known Man, <hi>viz.</hi> 32000, their Sheep which were 675,000, their Beeves 72,000, and Aſſes 61,000; ſo that God powred Contempt upon that Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Whoring Nation in deſtroying them by ſuch an Inconſiderable Number of men.</p>
            <p>It's alſo to be obſerved that <hi>Moſes</hi> was very Angry with the Captains for having ſaved all the Women, and the reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for it, is this, Becauſe they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> firſt to Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and then to Idolatry; and therefore he Commanded every Woman who had known a Man to be deſtroyed, and thus thoſe Women who thought to have ſav'd their Country by Proſtituting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, did thereby accelerate the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of themſelves and their Country too,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110363:37"/> and the <hi>Midianitiſls</hi> Men who conſented to this Helliſh Stratagem of expoſing their Wives to ſave themſelves did thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ruin of both, and their Virgins became a prey to the Conquerors.</p>
            <p>The juſt hatred of God againſt this <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Nation</hi> appears likewiſe in this, that their Furniture, Gold, Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not to be made uſe of by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 'till puriſied by Fire and Water according to the nature of the thing; ſo abominable in the Eyes of God are <hi>all thoſe things ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are ſome who make an exception to the truth of this Hiſtory of the Total deſtruction of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> becauſe they afterwards invaded <hi>Iſrael</hi> in great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in <hi>Gideon</hi>'s time, but the ſolution is eaſie; by the Total deſtruction may be meant that of the Generality; or ſome of them might eſcape to the Neighbouring Nations, and return again with Foreign Colonies to re-inhabit their deſolate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which the <hi>Iſraclites</hi> were not to ſlay in, but preſs'd forward towards the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo the new Inhabitants aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the Name of the Country might invade the <hi>Iſraclites</hi> in the days of <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

            <p> We have already conſidered Inceſtuous and Unlawfull Marriages, as they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whom God would have diſtinguiſh'd from other Nations, not only in reſpect of the purity of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, but even in their Apparel, Hair, and laudable Cuſtoms: as <hi>Maimonides</hi> and others think: And we come now to conſider thoſe Inceſtuous Marriages and Promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Copulations, as the Cauſes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> amongſt whom they had dwelt; and of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> in whoſe Land they were to dwell, as it is particularly expreſſed in the 18th Chapter of <hi>Leviticus.</hi> It's true that all along in the Book of <hi>Exodus</hi> the Chief Crime of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> taken notice of, is, Oppreſſion and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; but, as we have ſaid before, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and Uncleanneſs are Generally Companions; and we find that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was one great Cauſe of the Envy and Hatred of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> towards them, which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> That <hi>Iſrael</hi> had plaid the Harlot in the days of her Youth, when ſhe was in the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> there's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, that too too many of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were infected with the corrupt Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110363:38"/> and Horſes, by the Prophet, in theſe words, <hi>Whoſe Members are as the Members of Aſſes, and whoſe Iſſue is as the Iſſue of Horſes.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians tell us, That it was uſual amongſt the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for Brothers and Siſters to Marry together; and that they made a Statute for the Lawfulneſs of it, becauſe <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> their Goddeſs was Married to her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Oſiris.</hi> Then ſeeing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had convers'd amongſt them 200 Years, and had not only ſeen but learned their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manners, and been witneſſes to all the plagues inflicted upon them on that Account, there could not be a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Caution given them, than to beware of their Practices. It is alſo to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the <hi>Arabians,</hi> amongſt whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wandered, married none but their own Kindred; That the <hi>Perſians</hi> held it Lawfull for the Fathers to marry with their Daughters; and the <hi>Parthians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it no Crime for the Mothers to marry with their Sons; ſo much were thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries drowned in Uncleanneſs; whence it is plain that Whoredom was one of the principal Cauſes of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It's true, that in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time it would ſeem that ſuch Inceſtuous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were not Common amongſt the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> otherwiſe his advice to <hi>Sara</hi> to (ſay that ſhe was his Siſter) would have been no Argument to make the <hi>Egyptians</hi> conclude, that ſhe was not his Wife: But it is plain from Hiſtorians, that afterwards they grew more licentious. And thus
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110363:38"/> 
               <hi>Ptolemy Pihladelphus</hi> married his Siſter <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinoe,</hi> and <hi>Soter</hi> and <hi>Philopater, Egyptian</hi> Kings, did alſo marry their own Siſters: And it's a known Story of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that when <hi>Cambyſes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> had a mind to his youngeſt Siſter, and ask'd his Judges whether there were any Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; they anſwered him, That they knew none, but that there was a Law, that the King's of <hi>Perſia</hi> might do what they would—Then 'tis alſo known that the <hi>Meſſagates, Troglodites, Brachmans,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People, allowed a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Wives, their Philoſophers taught it, and <hi>Crates</hi> and <hi>Cabades</hi> Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> made Laws for it.</p>
            <p>Another of the Crimes forbidden to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and which the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People were guilty of, was, cauſing their Seed to paſs through the fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> by which ſome underſtand that in a moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy manner they conſecrated their Sperm or Seed to their Idol <hi>Priapus,</hi> as <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their Blood to their Idol, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18. and as the <hi>Manichees</hi> and <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Euchariſt with humane Seed; tho' the Current of Interpreters carry it for making their Children paſs through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two fires, and ſometimes offering them as a burnt-Sacrifice in Honour of their Idol.</p>
            <p>They are alſo charged with <hi>Sodomy,</hi> or the Unnatural Luſt of Men towards Men, to which they were given up by the Juſt Judgment of God as a due puniſhment for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110363:39"/> their Idolatry. And at the diſſolution of the Monaſtcries here in <hi>England,</hi> our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chriſtian Idolaters were found to have polluted themſelves in this manner; which Crime as it brought Hell upon the <hi>Sodomites</hi> before their time, (that is, brought Fire and Brimſtone upon them before they went off the Earth,) ſo this horrid Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs of the <hi>Monks</hi> procur'd the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Monaſteries by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII before their Religion was diſcharged out of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Canaanites</hi> are alſo charged with Beſtiality, their Men and Women having committed Confuſion with Beaſts, and thus <hi>Paſiphae</hi> is accuſed of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accompanied with a Bull, <hi>Polyphantes</hi> with a Bear, <hi>Semiramis</hi> with an Horſe, and the Women of <hi>Mendis</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> with Goats.—Nay if we may believe the Fables of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the falſe Prophet <hi>Balaam,</hi> who was ſlain amongſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> was guilty of Beſtiality with his Aſs, which they fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly collect from thoſe Words of the Beaſt, <hi>viz. Am not I thine Aſs which thou haſt rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon?</hi> It is alſo obſervable, that thoſe brutal Commixtious were puniſh'd by the Infamy of the Criminals, as well as by their deſtruction, for we read, that the Monſtrous Births have many times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered thoſe Unnatural Crimes, and that ſometimes they have been betrayed by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous tho perfect Births. And thus <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us of a Boy begotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Man and a Mare, and of a Girl
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110363:39"/> betwixt a Man and an Aſs—And <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> mentions a Man begotten of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by a Bear, who was thereupon called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſus,</hi> and of whom many Great <hi>Paniſh</hi> Princes did afterwards deſcend.—It's true that <hi>Galen</hi> denies that there can be any ſuch Generation of Mankind, but others maintain it upon this reaſon, <hi>That the Partial Cauſe being more Noble prevails over the leſs Noble, as it is many times ſeen that a fair Woman hath brought forth a Black-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> being pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by thoſe abominations, Vomited out her Inhabitants, the Poſterity of <hi>Cham,</hi> who did ſo impudently behold and revile his Father's Nakedneſs, and is thought to have revived the Vitious manners of the old World in his Poſterity, the <hi>Sodomites</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and thus we have an account of two more Great Nations deſtroyed by their Uncleanneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> whoſe Practices the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Commanded to avoid, as they would not run the hazard of the ſame or greater Judgments.</p>
            <p>The next Remarkable Inſtance we meet with in Scripture, is that of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who having a mind to take one of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to Wife, for which ſome Commentators are of opinion that he had a particular Revelation, or at leaſt a Divine Inſtinct, ſhe proved unfaithfull to him, and as <hi>Levi Ben Gerſon</hi> alledges, the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> youths Committed Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110363:40"/> with her, and by that means came to the knowledge of her Husbands Riddle: and this Interpretation he thinks to be favoured by <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>That if they had not Plowed with his Heifer they had not found out his Riddle,</hi> but whether it were ſo or not, this is certain, that ſhe was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the breach of Conjugal Fidelity, which iſſued in the deſtruction of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and People, that ſhe thought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void by this piece of Treachery. This is alſo certain, that ſhe afterwards defiled the Marriage Bed, when <hi>Sampſon</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her in Anger, upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of diſcovering his Riddle which makes <hi>Levi Ben Gerſon</hi>'s Accuſation ſo much the more probable, eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that ſhe was by her Father beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Companion, <hi>viz.</hi> one of thoſe that had accompanied him at the Marriage ſolemnity; which diſcovers the Looſneſſes of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> in a very Emphatical manner, and made <hi>Sampſon</hi> a very Juſt inſtrument of Revenge upon 'em and perhaps the Fulſomeneſs and Cunning of their Crime was very aptly puniſhed by tying thoſe ſtinking and Cunning Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Foxes tail to tail with Fire-brands betwixt them, by which they burnt the Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields and Vineyards of the Crafty and Impure <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> The objection which ſome make againſt this Story, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was impoſſible to find ſo many Foxes, is frivolous; it's plain that thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were very Numerous in <hi>Syria</hi> and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110363:40"/> 
               <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> and they are mentioned in the <hi>Capticles</hi> as ſpoilers of the Vines, for theſe Creatures are great admirers of Ripe Grapes; ſo that for ſuch an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Perſon as <hi>Sampſon</hi> to catch ſuch a Number of Foxes where they did ſo much abound, was no hard matter; It's certain that they were the moſt proper of any Creature for his purpoſe ſeeing they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Corn-fields and Vineyards, and by Conſequence run ſtraight thither; where as if he had made uſe of Dogs, they would have run to the Houſes where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might eaſily have Quenched the Brands.</p>
            <p>The next thing obſervable in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, is, the Juſt puniſhment which was inflicted upon <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Treacherous wife, and her Father, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> burnt them with fire, a very proper pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſuch a Luſtfull Family as this appears to have been, both by <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Wife's proving falſe to him, who was certainly able enough to perform his Conjugal duty, and alſo by her Father's inceſtuous offer of the younger Siſter to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which ſhews that the fear of God was not in the Family: And this Villainous practice of theirs did not only draw deſtruction upon themſelves, but on their polluted Country, and therefore this Revenge of deſtroying their Corn and Wine in the firſt place was very proper, idleneſs and fulneſs of Bread being great provocatives to Uncleanneſs, and the old ſaying is found to be true <hi>ſine Baccho &amp;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110363:41"/> Cerere friget Venus.</hi> Take away Corn and Wine, and Lechery will ceaſe. But this was not all the puniſhment inflicted upon that Impure People, for he ſmote them hip and thigh where ever he met them, and ſhortly after killed a thouſand of 'em with the Jaw bone of an Aſs; and thus a Villainous People were cut off in an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomimous manner, by the Jaw bone of one of the dulleſt and moſt deſpicable Beaſts.</p>
            <p>The next Inſtance of Divine Wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fornication is <hi>Sampſon</hi> himſelf, who tho' he had been the Executioner of God's Juſtice upon the Impure <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> yet fell into the ſame Crime, and Repeated it to the eminent danger, and at laſt to the loſs of his Life: He was once Beſieged by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> in <hi>Gaza,</hi> when he was with a Whore, and tho' God had not deſerted him then, ſo that he eſcaped them by his great ſtrength and carrying away the Gates on his Shoulders, yet he was ſo far from taking warning, that he becomes enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Strumpet <hi>Delilah,</hi> and was ſo much beſotted with his Luſt, that tho' ſhe had given him many demonſtrations of her Treacherous deſign to betray him into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> yet he could not reſcue himſelf from her ſnares, but at laſt became a Prey and Scorn to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, a Scandal and a Reproach to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and an occaſion of Triumph to Idolaters, who aſcrib'd their Conqueſt over him to their Idols, and put him in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110363:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> Priſon in that ſame City where he firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>This is a ſecond Scriptural Inſtance of ſnares laid againſt the Church of God by Unclean Women, the firſt being by the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and the ſecond by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> which tho' they prov'd fatal to the People of God for a time, yet both of 'em ended in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Contrivers and Abettors; for the <hi>Midianites,</hi> we have heard were Tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed; and now we find that <hi>Sampſon</hi> deſtroyed more <hi>Philiſtines</hi> at his Death than he did during his Life, and thoſe the Lords or Chief of 'em too.</p>
            <p>Nor is it unworthy our obſervation that the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who attack'd the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and endeavour'd to undermine it in <hi>Charles</hi> Il's. time, by Court-Whores, and others; tho' they had ſucceſs for a while, yet their deſigns have turned to their own diſgrace, and come to nothing at laſt.</p>

            <p>It has been hinted before that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Uncleanneſs of the popiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy contributed to the diſſolution of their Monaſteries in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere which, we ſhall touch upon again in it's proper place, but it may not be improper to take notice here, that <hi>Socrates</hi> gives us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that private Confeſſion was aboliſht at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> becauſe a certain Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>But to return again to <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, their puniſhment did not terminate in their own Perſons, but reach'd their Father, who, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> thinks wept continually after God had revealed to him that both his Sons ſhould be ſlain in one day, and the Scripture tells us, that he fell backward and broke his Neek upon the receipt of that fatal News. It reach'd alſo the Wife of one of 'em, who died upon the News of her Husband's death, and the Arks being taken; and it reach'd alſo their Poſterity who were for ever excluded from the Prieſt's Office and had a perpetual Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty entailed upon them, as a Curſe, and to make them the more ſenſible of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, from whence they had fallen, they were condemned to be a ſort of ſlaves to the High-Prieſt of the ſucceeding Family, of whom they were to beg a morſel of Bread and Employment, ſo naturally does the Curſe of Poverty or of bringing a Man to a piece of Bread follow upon Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Uncleanneſs.</p>

            <p>The Inſtance of <hi>Abner</hi>'s going into <hi>Rispah, Saul</hi>'s Concubine, which Interpreters think he did in an Adulterous manner, and not by way of Lawfull Marriage, deſerves our Remark; for hereby <hi>Saul</hi> ſuffered in his Fame after his Death, and he who had compelled his Daughter to defile her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Bed, had this Ignominy and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted upon his Son, that he ſaw his Fathers Wife diſhonourably defiled, and <hi>Abner,</hi> who was guilty of that Villanous Action, took occaſion, becauſe of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, to Revolt from him and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Kingdom to <hi>David,</hi> and as he went about to effect it, fell into the ſnare which <hi>Joab</hi> had laid for him, and loſt his Life.</p>
            <p>We come, in the next place to <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> a Crime, which hath many aggravations, to be committed by <hi>David</hi> a prophet who inſtructed others in the Law of God, and did ſo groſly break it himſelf, to be committed by <hi>David,</hi>

But the bloody part of the Scene is ſtill to be acted, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> finding that he could not effect his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign by Hypocriſy, hath recourſe to down-right Violence and Murder, his Intrigue to make <hi>

            <p>The Crime is ſtill further aggravated if we conſider how deliberately it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, how long he continued without Repentance, and what a ſevere Judgment he gave againſt himſelf, when <hi>Nathan</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet propounded the Caſe to him by way of Parable.

It remains then that we come to the puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon both.</p>
            <p>The Judgment pronounced by <hi>Nathan</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> was, That the Sword ſhould never depart from his Houſe, that the Lord would raiſe up evil againſt him out of his own Houſe, that he would take his Wives before his Eyes and give them unto his Neighbour, who ſhould lie with them in the ſight of the Sun, and that the Child which he had begot in Adultery, ſhould ſurely die, all which was exactly fullfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

            <p>The firſt part of the puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, was the Death of the Child, and how near that went to <hi>David,</hi> may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perceived by his afflicting himſelf with faſting and bying all night upon the Earth while it was ſick, and there's no doubt but this part of the puniſhment reach'd <hi>Bathſheba</hi> as well as him, ſeeing 'tis reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the Death of a Child, for whom ſhe had broke through all ties, Divine and Humane, muſt go ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near her.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:110363:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>David,</hi> of having his own Wives taken from him, and given to another, who ſhould humble them in the ſight of the Sun, and of all the People; and it is remarkable, that this Villainy was Acted upon the roof of the King's Houſe, where he himſelf did firſt commit Adultery with <hi>Bathſheba</hi> in his Heart—The reaſon of <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this pernicious advice; was, that he might do what in him lay to make the breach between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable, that ſo he might never be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an Account for aiding <hi>Abſalom</hi> in this Rebellion: and there are others, who ſay, that he had alſo a deſign of Revenge in it, for <hi>David</hi>'s having Debauch'd <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi> who, it's probable, was this <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi>'s Grand-Daughter.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s own part in this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, we have reaſon to think that he was thereunto prompted by Revenge and Luſt both. Revenge, becauſe his Father had not puniſh'd <hi>Amnon</hi> for his Rape upon <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> his Siſter; and Luſt, becauſe we find he was a Vain and Effeminate Perſon, and Exceſſively proud of his Beauty and Hair, which he nouriſhed ſo prodigiouſly, that at the end of the year, when he poll'd it, he uſually cut off about Two Hundred Shekells, which is computed at above six Pound <hi>Averdupoize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing which in Courſe we are to take notice of, is the puniſhment inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Achitophel,</hi> who gave this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Counſel, and upon <hi>Abſalom</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:110363:49"/> it: The former, tho' his Wicked advice as to the polluting of <hi>David</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines was obey'd, yet finding his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel as to the Military part deſpiſed, took it ſo much to heart, that he thereupon became a deliberate <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet his Houſe in order, became the Executioner of a puniſhment upon himſelf, which ought to have been inflicted by the hands of others, as a Juſt reward for his having adviſed to the Commiſſion of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Crimes. And thus fell <hi>Achitophel</hi> as a true Type of <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> his puniſhment was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable. His Father <hi>David</hi> againſt whom he had committed thoſe Capital of fences, was ſo ſtrangely indulgent that he gave his Captains particular Charge to deal kindly with him for his ſake; but behold the Event, that Unnatural Monſter, whom the Indulgence of a Father would have ſpared, the Juſtice of Heav'n would not ſuffer to go unpuniſh'd, but armed the Trees of the Foreſt againſt him, ſo that his Hair being caught by the branch of an Oak, that in which he ſo much Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, became the means of his Ruin, and ſerv'd inſtead of a Rope to hang him up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Heav'n and Earth, as a Monument of Divine Juſtice, and to ſhew that he was accurſed; but that was not all, Divine Juſtice did ſo much Incenſe <hi>Joab</hi> againſt him that taking three Darts in his hand he ſoon diſpatch'd him, ſo that he died more ſorts of Deaths than one, as a Juſt reward
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:110363:50"/> for his Complicated Crimes. <hi>R. Kimchi</hi>'s Obſervations upon <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Tragical Exit, are neither improper nor Unpleaſant, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It's not unreaſonable to conjecture that <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Beauty and the Authority which he had then uſurp'd might make them the more eaſily conſent to his Lewd Embraces, and therefore they are puniſh'd for their Incontinence by a perpetual deprivation of Man's Society.

That <hi>Solomon</hi> the Wiſeſt of men ſhould be ſo far beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Luſt, or to uſe a ſofter Term, Amorous Inclinations, to as tranſgreſs that Royal Law which forbid Kings to Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Wives to themſelves, and that other Law which forbid the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to marry with ſuch and ſuch Nations; but yet more, that he ſhould be ſo exceſſive in Number which we find to be no leſs than 1000, whereof 700 were of Noble Extract or Princeſſes, and 300 of lower degree; and that which is ſtill more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, that <hi>Solomon</hi> whom God call'd <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didiah</hi> his beloved, and made him a Type of Chriſt, and to whom he had twice appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a ſolemn manner ſhould be ſo far overcome with the Inticements of thoſe Outlandiſh and Strange Women as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their Gods, and promote their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when he was betwixt 50 and 60 years of Age, a time as one would think more proper for him to have been preparing for Death and Eternity, and Eſtabliſhing the true worſhip of God, for which he was the firſt that had built a Temple, than to be led away by ſuch youthfull Luſts and to build high places for the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idols of the <hi>Moabites, Zidonians &amp;c.</hi> which Interpreters ſay, were Immodeſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> that were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110363:53"/> worſhiped by the Inceſtuous off-ſpring of <hi>Lot,</hi> by his own Daughters. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confirmation of what has been ſo often obſerved, that there is no ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull attractive to Idolatry and falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as an Impure Life.</p>
            <p>The next thing we are to take notice of is the puniſhment inflicted upon <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Poſterity for their Crimes, which we find to be, that the Lord was Angry with him, threatned to rend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from him, and to give it to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and ſtir'd up Enemies againſt him both at home and abroad, as <hi>Hadad,</hi> the <hi>Edon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It likewiſe deſerves our Remark, that this foul defection of <hi>Solomon</hi> occaſions a great diſpute amongſt Interpreters whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever he recovered or not, becauſe the Scripture is ſilent concerning it. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Great, <hi>Theodoret, Proſper, Aquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Beda, Rabanus, Peter Martyr</hi> and others, think that he was damn'd for it; and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Ambroſe, Iſidore, Epiphanius, Criſſus,</hi> and others, think that God gave him Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that he wrote the Eccleſiaſtes after his Recovery. However this is plain that <hi>Solomon's</hi> Luſtfulneſs occaſioned his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and both together that Revolt of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from his Poſterity, which is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110363:54"/> not the only Inſtance that we ſhall meet with of Thrones being overturned by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</p>
            <p>We ſhall alſo obſerve here once for all, that thoſe high Places and Groves, which in the time of <hi>Jeroboam, Rehoboam,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are accus'd of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping their Idols in, were choſen as pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fit for their purpoſe, not only upon the Account on which the Heathens choſe ſuch places, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they thought them nearer the Heavens and the Heavenly Gods, as on the Contrary they worſhiped in Dens and Caves to the Infernal Gods; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there they had a greater Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of fullfilling their Brutiſh Luſts, to which they were incited by the fulſome Statues of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Priapus,</hi> which they had in thoſe places, and to whom they thought that was agreeable worſhip; and therefore it is that the Prophets do ſo often upbraid them with going a Whoring from the true God, and being lain with under every Green-Tree, and upon every High-Hill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was true in a Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as well as Metaphorical and Spiritual Senſe, ſo inſeparable are Idolatry and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity; and here likewiſe we may obſerve once for all, That in all thoſe Captivities and publick Calamities which befell the People of God, Uncleanneſs and Idolatry concurr'd, as procuring Cauſes; of which we have a clear Proof in the 14th. of the 1ſt. Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> 23d. and 24th. Verſes, where, after they are accuſed of building
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110363:54"/> them high places, Images and Groves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every Green-Tree and upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high Hill; it's ſtraightway ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there were alſo <hi>Sodomites</hi> in the Land and they did according to all the Abominations of the Nations which the Lord, caſt out before the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> ſo that Idolatry, Adultery and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Luſt, were productive of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being Juſt with God to give up thoſe who did not like to retain him in their knowledge, to work all manner of Unncleanneſs with Greedineſs.</p>
            <p>It's proper alſo to obſerve here, that as the Wicked Princes and Rulers erected thoſe Groves and high Places, ſo the good ones whenever they attempted a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remov'd and broke them down, as in the Inſtances of <hi>Jereboam, Aſa, Ahab, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Remarkable Inſtance is in <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> who was an Harlot, Perſecuter, Idolater, and bloody Woman, thoſe ſins being ſo near a kin that they were many times found in one and the ſame ſubject, we find that ſhe was rather worſe then <hi>Ahab</hi> her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band who ſold himſelf to do evil, and was more wicked than any King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been before him; but that which more particularly relates to our purpoſe is her Uncleanneſs and many Whoredoms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe is ſo plainly Charged by <hi>Jehu;</hi> The Judgment of God upon her for thoſe Crimes is very obſervable; ſhe ſeem'd to have ſo little ſenſe of approaching Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110363:55"/> tho' ſhe had heard how <hi>Jehu</hi> cut off all <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Houſe, that as he was coming to the Pallace ſhe painted her ſelf in an Obſtinate and Whoriſh manner, as if ſhe were either reſolv'd to outbrave the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and to die with Obſtinacy and Impenitence in that very ſin which haſtned wrath upon her; or that ſhe thought thereby to bewitch <hi>Jehu,</hi> and convert his Rage into an Amorous Paſſion; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Event, he Commands her to be thrown headlong out at the Window, which being effected, that Body which ſhe had ſo much pampered and adorn'd, had the burial of an Aſs, <hi>viz.</hi> To be eaten up by Dogs, and thrown as dung upon the face of the Field, as had been threatned by the Prophet, a ſuitable <hi>Exit</hi> for ſuch a Vile and Abominable Life, which may ſerve as a dreadfull warning to our Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ladies.</p>
            <p>Having thus run thro' all the principal old Teſtament Inſtances of Uncleanneſs and the Judgments inflicted upon thoſe that were guilty by God, from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Captivity of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that offers it ſelf to our obſervation, is that paſſage in the 9th and 10th of <hi>Ezra,</hi> where, after the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People: One of the General ſins which they lamented and reformed, was, their having taken ſtrange Wives, and liv'd a Looſe and Licentious life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Abominations of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanlies, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebuſites, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110363:55"/> Moabites, Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Amorites,</hi> whom the Lord had deſtroyed for thoſe Crimes; and we find that the very Prieſts were polluted with this Contagion, ſo far had Luſt got the aſcendent over the Laws of God. But when they had been haraſs'd with Judgments and brought to ſet about a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, then they willingly put away thoſe ſtrange Wives according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Prophets on pain of Forfeiture and Excommunication. We find alſo that when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came to Rebuild <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and reform the <hi>Jews,</hi> he inſiſted upon their putting away of their ſtrange Wives, and chas'd away one of the Prieſts, becauſe he was Son-in-Law to <hi>Sanballat</hi> the <hi>Horonite;</hi> concerning which <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Story, viz. <hi>That the Perſon thus cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away by</hi> Nehemiah, <hi>was</hi> Manaſſes, <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the High Prieſt</hi> Jaddus, <hi>who refuſing to put away this ſtrange Woman, was driven out of the Prieſthood, and thereupon going to his Father in-Law</hi> Sanballat, <hi>who was made Prince or Governour of</hi> Samaria <hi>by</hi> Darius <hi>the laſt King of the</hi> Perſians, <hi>he told him how he had been treated and thruſt from the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by his Brother</hi> Jaddus <hi>or</hi> Jaiada, <hi>(whoſe Colleague he was) upon the account of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; whereupon</hi> Sanballat <hi>encouraged him to retain his Wife, promiſing that he would take care that he ſhould not only enjoy the Prieſthood but alſo the Principal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110363:56"/> than the reſt of the Hills, and reſembled that of Mount</hi> Moriah <hi>upon which the Temple of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſtood; which deſign took ſo well, that all the</hi> Jews <hi>who had transgreſſed in the matter of ſtrange Wives followed this</hi> Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>and made him a ſtrong party.</hi> Darins <hi>in the mean time being overcome by</hi> Alexander, <hi>who was then Beſieging</hi> Tyre, Sanballat <hi>went thither, acknowledged</hi> Alexander <hi>for his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and obtained leave from him to build the ſaid Temple, wherein his Son-in-Law</hi> Manaſſes <hi>officiated as High-Prieſt, and all ſuch as tranſgreſſed the Law at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>fled to him for Protection, ſo that it became an Aſylum or Sanctuary for diſſolute Perſons.</hi> This hightned the Enmity ſo much betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that the former could never be reconciled to the latter, even after that Temple was demoliſh'd by <hi>Hircanus</hi> after 100 years ſtanding, and the <hi>Samaritans</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſaid demolition, ſtill held the Mountain on which it ſtood Sacred, and hated thoſe who went to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as appears by the Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>'s treatment of our Saviour, <hi>Luke.</hi> 9. 53. Where ſhe told him that their Fathers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in that Mountain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation which naturally reſults from this paſſage and makes it applicable to our purpoſe, is, that Luſt or Unlawfull Love to ſtrange Women does naturally turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heart from God, and makes Men become eaſie Proſelytes to Idolatry or a falſe Religion.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:110363:56"/>
            <p> Having thus gone thro' all the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al paſſages of the old. Teſtament which have any reference to our Subject, it may not be improper to cloſe that part of our Hiſtory with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Character of Lewd Women, Whoremongers, Whoredom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which he was the beſt able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any Man that ever liv'd, not only becauſe of the aſſiſtance of the Divine ſpirit which inſpired his Pen, but becauſe of his own Experience. In the ſecond of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> he tells us, That Wiſdom will deliver us from the Strange Woman, who flattereth with her words, forſaketh her Husband the guide of her youth., and forgetteth her Marriage Vows, the Covenant of her God, her Houſe inclineth unto death, and her Paths unto the dead; that is, lead both to Temporal and Eternal deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, none that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the Paths of Life; That is, few who haunt the Society of ſuch Women do ever find Grace to repent of it, or to betake themſelves again to a chaſte Life.</p>
            <p>In his 5th. Chapter he purſues her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter thus, <hi>That her Lips drop as an Hony-Comb, and her Mouth is ſmoother than oil; but her end is bitter as Wormwood, ſharp as a two edged Sword, her feet go down to death, her Steps take hold on Hell, her ways are move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that thou canſt not know them;</hi> That is ſometimes fawning and ſometimes frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſhe thinks ſhe can beſt work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the humours of her Lovers: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110363:57"/> he adviſes to remove far from her and not to come nigh her Houſe, Leſt we give our honour unto others and our years unto the cruel; that is, leſt we Sacrifice our Reputation and Strength to Harlots, who are cruel both in Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes. He adds as further ill Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of following Whores, Leſt ſtrangers be filled with thy Wealth, and thy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours be in the Houſe of a ſtranger, and thou mourn at the laſt, when thy Fleſh and thy Body are conſumed. Then he Exhorts to Conjugal Love and Chaſtity in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner, Drink Waters out of thine own Ciſtern, <hi>i. e.</hi> Content thy ſelf with thine own Wife: Let thy Fountain be bleſſed, and rejoice with the Wife of thy youth. Let her be as the loving Hind and the pleaſant Roe; let her Breaſts ſatisfy thee at all times, and be thou Raviſh'd always with her love. Then he concludes with an Expoſtulation againſt Whoredom, from the miſchiefs which attend it, thus? <hi>Why wilt thou be raviſh'd with a ſtrange Woman, and embrace the Boſom of a ſtranger; for the ways of Man are before the Eyes of the Lord, he pondereth all his goings: his own Iniquities shall take the wicked himſelf, and he shall be holden with the Cords of his Sins, he shall die without inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and in the Greatneſs of his Folly, he shall go aſtray.</hi> That is, he is ſo enſnared by his Luſts, that thro' his prodigious folly and madneſs he ſhall run on to eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, without repenting for his ſins as perhaps he purpoſed to do.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:110363:57"/>
            <p> In the 6th Chapter he purſues his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to Chaſtity by further Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the miſchievous Conſequences of Whoredom. Thus, <hi>Keep thee from the evil Woman, from the flattery of the Tongue of a ſtrange Woman, Luſt not after her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her Eye-lids, for by means of a Whorish Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a Man is brought to a piece of Bread and the Adultreſs will hunt for the precious Life,</hi> that is, draws men to ſuch Courſes as deſtroys both their ſubſtance and health. He goes on thus, That whoſoever toucheth his Neighbours Wife ſhall not be Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhall not be free from guilt, ſhame and puniſhment.—He adds, <hi>That whoſo commits Adultery with a Woman lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth underſtanding, and deſtroyeth his own Soul: a Wound and Dishonour shall he get, and his Reproach shall not be wiped away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 7th. Chapter he gives a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Repreſentation of Whoring, thus, <hi>At the Window of my Houſe I look'd thro' my Caſement, and behold among the ſimple ones a young man void of underſtanding, paſſing thro' the Street near her Corner, and he went the way to her Houſe, in the twi-light, in the Evening, in the black and dark Night: And behold there met him a Woman, with the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of an Harlot, and ſubtil of Heart.

            <p>In the 9th Chap. he calls the Whore, a Fooliſh, Clamorous, Simple, Ignorant, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and deſcribes her Practice thus, <hi>That ſhe ſits at the Door of her Houſe, on a ſeat in the high or noted places of the City, to call paſſengers who go right on their ways;</hi> That is who are going about their buſineſs and mind no ſuch things. Then he deſcribes her Gueſts to be ſimple, and thoſe that want underſtanding: And ſuch as know not that they are in the depths of Hell; Had the Royal Author lived in our days the Wits of this Age would no doubt have call'd him a Canting Coxcomb, and if the Dignity of his Scepter had not ſet him above it, to be ſure they would have demanded ſatisfaction of him; but he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:110363:58"/> himſelf better, and knew that Whoring which deſtroyeth Kings as he expreſſeth it in the 30th Chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> could be no leſs fatal to Fops. He had given his heart to know madneſs and folly as much as any of 'em, and was not aſham'd to declare that he found it to be ſuch, and therefore Repented of it.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerved before that bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Uncleanneſs as well as Idolatry, had a great ſhare in Provoking God to give the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> upto Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and other publick Calamities, which appears plain to any Man that will but peruſe the Prophets, and particularly <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> who Propheſied both before and after they were carried Captives into <hi>Babylon, viz.</hi> In the days of <hi>Zedekiah, &amp;c.</hi> In the third Chapter of his Prophecy he bids them lift up their Eyes unto the high places, and ſee where they had not been lain with, and charges them with polluting the Land by their Whoredoms and Wickedneſs. In the 5th. Chap. God charges them with committing Adultery, aſſembling themſelves by Troops in the Harlots' Houſes, after they had been fed to the full, and that they were as fed Horſes in the morning every one Neighing after his Neighbours Wife; The very Practice of our City Beaus and modern Gallants, and as a Juſt reward for ſuch Wickedneſs, the Lord ſays, <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things, and ſhall not my Soul be avenged on ſuch a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Chapter, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues his threatnings, telling them, That their Houſes ſhould be turned unto others, with their Fields and Wives together, as a Juſt Judgment for their having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd other Men's Wives; and that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were to come againſt them ſhould lay hold on Bow and Spear, be Cruel and ſhew no Mercy.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:110363:60"/> the Juſt Judgment of God burnt in the fire by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the Memory of their Crime and Puniſhment was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated to Poſterity by this Curſe among the <hi>Jews: The Lord make thee like</hi> Zedekiah <hi>and like</hi> Ahab <hi>whom the K. of</hi> Babylon <hi>roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the fire;</hi> So that the fire of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Luſt was puniſhed by a more ſevere puniſhment than that of a fiery Ordeal, for as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> thinks they were fried and ſo burnt to death by degrees, as they had from time to time burnt in their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.

            <p> All Hiſtorians who write of the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> agree, that they were a very Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xurious People, and it is not at all to be doubted but their Luxury and Laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as it drew down the Judgments of God upon them, ſo it rendred them Effeminate, and made them an eaſie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to others, after they had Conquer'd ſo many Nations themſelves. The Extent of this City was prodigious, being as <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> ſays 46 <hi>English</hi> Miles in Compaſs—<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, That it was rather a Country than a City, and that when it was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> it was three days before the Inhabitants of the furthieſt parts were aware of it. It's Walls were of Brick cemented with Bitumen, 32 Foot thick, 50 Cubits high, and defended by Towers 10 Foot higher.

And to make the Judgment ſo much the more Remarkable,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:110363:61"/> they were terrified by the prodigy of a hand writing upon the Wall, which made <hi>Belshazzar</hi>'s knees ſmite together for fear, and foretold the impending Fate of himſelf and his Gueſts, and the deſtruction of his Kingdom. It is worth our obſervation, that this Famous City, the wonder and the Metropolis of the World, ſo Beautiful and Commodiouſly ſituated, ſhould, for the Luxury and other Crimes of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, be turned into a Wilderneſs by the juſt Judgment of God, when according to the ordinary Methods of Men, it might be ſuppoſed that the Conquerors would have taken all imaginable care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch an Important City for their own Glory and Profit; but it decay'd Gradually, till at laſt it came to be turned into a Park for Hunting by the Kings of <hi>Perſia;</hi> ſo that in that very place where the Impure <hi>Babylonians</hi> had been ſo much guilty of Whore-Hunting, their Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors took their pleaſure to Hunt Beaſts of a far more harmleſs Nature.</p>

            <p>We have done with the old Teſtament Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo that we muſt come next to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who is favourable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to his Countrymen in reſpect of their Uncleanneſs, as particularly in the Inſtance of the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Women, with whom he alledges they contracted Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and ſays expreſly, That <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi</hi> were Married, whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture accuſes them of down-right Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Luſt; neither does this Hiſtorian Tax the Patriarchs for their Polygamy, which perhaps might be occaſioned by his being
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:110363:62"/> a Phariſee, who as it appears by our Saviour's Arguments with ſome of that Sect upon the ſubject of Divorce had no Juſt Notions of thoſe things—And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be wondered at that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> takes ſo little notice of the failings of his Countrymen as to this matter,—Yet ſome ſuch Inſtances he has tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Poſterity, and the firſt that we meet with for our purpoſe, is that of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi> King of the <hi>Jews, Herod</hi> the Great's Son, who Married <hi>Glaphyra</hi> that had been his Brother <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Wife, concerning which, he tells us this Remarkable Story, <hi>That</hi> Archelaus <hi>upon the ſight of this</hi> Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyra <hi>who was Daughter to</hi> Archelaus <hi>King of</hi> Cappadocia, <hi>was ſo inflamed with love to her, that he preſently Divorced his Wife</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamne <hi>and Married her, but ſoon after ſhe came to</hi> Judea, <hi>ſhe dreamt that ſhe ſaw</hi> Alexander <hi>her firſt Husband ſtanding before and accoſting her in this manner,</hi> viz. <hi>It had been enough for thee to have Married the King of</hi> Libya, <hi>but not contented therewith, thou comeſt again to mine Houſe, Greedy of a third Husband, and which is worſt of all, art now Married to my own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I will not conceal nor diſſemble this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that thou doeſt me, but I will recover thee againſt thy will and ſhe ſcarcely liv'd two days; after ſhe had related this dream to her Friends;</hi> ſo much for her puniſhment. Then as to <hi>Archelaus</hi> who had been guilty of this Adultery and Inceſt, he himſelf was ſent for to <hi>Rome</hi> upon an Accuſation of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> who ſent Ambaſſadors againſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:110363:63"/> him to <hi>Caeſar—</hi>and thereupon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror baniſht him to <hi>Vienne</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and confiſcated all his Goods, of which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments he was alſo forewarned by a Dream, and five days after the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, was ſent for by <hi>Caeſar</hi> as above.</p>
            <p>It is alſo obſervable and not at all Foreign to our purpoſe, that though <hi>Joſephus</hi> does not accuſe <hi>Herod</hi> the Great of Whoredom, but ſeems rather to commend his Chaſtity in that he held out againſt the Charms and Sollicitations of that Infamous Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> yet he tells us, that <hi>Herod</hi> had nine Wives at a time, and doted ſo Impotently upon his Wife <hi>Mariamne,</hi> that when he was ſent for to <hi>Rome</hi> and had ſome reaſons to think that he ſhou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return thence alive, he gave orders to his Brother-in-Law <hi>Joſeph</hi> to put <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamne</hi> to Death, as ſoon as he ſhould hear that he was dead, being unwilling that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man ſhould enjoy her after his death; and becauſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> diſcovered this Secret to <hi>Mariamne, Herod</hi> became Jealous of an Unlawful Intimacy betwixt his Brother-in-Law and her, eſpecially being influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe ſome ſuch thing by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations of his Siſter <hi>Salome, Joſeph</hi>'s Wife, who accuſed her Husband of being too Familiar with <hi>Mariamne.</hi> Whether there was any truth in the accuſation or not, or whether it was meer malice; yet this is certain, that <hi>Mariamne</hi> was at laſt put to death by her Husband, and by her own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charged with Diſloyalty to him, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110363:63"/> after her death <hi>Herod</hi> had ſo little Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his paſſion for her, that he would frequently call for her as if ſhe had been alive. Then as to his own puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us that he was cut off by a moſt loathſome diſeaſe, Worms ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bred in his private Parts, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inſupportable pains, an Intolerable Stench and a Troubleſome Priapiſm, which was a very ſuitable puniſhment for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence in having nine Wives at a time, tho' it ſhould be granted that he was chargeable with no other Acts of Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity.</p>
            <p>We come now to the Apocryphal ſtories of <hi>Judeth</hi> and <hi>Suſanna,</hi> which tho' we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are ſuch as may properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led apocryphal, ſeeing <hi>Joſephus</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorian takes no notice of either, yet allowing them to be Fables, the Moral is good, and therefore we ſhall allow them a place here.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that of <hi>Judith,</hi> who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Author of her Book was a Rich and a Pious Widow, of a Comely Perſonage and Beautiful Countenance, and finding her City of <hi>Bethulia</hi> cloſely Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and their Water cut off, which made the Governours to promiſe a ſurrender in ſive days if relief did not come in that time, ſhe deckt her ſelf with her Richeſt and fineſt Ornaments, and pretending to be fled from <hi>Bethulia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe knew it would fall into the hands of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and likewiſe to put <hi>Olo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:110363:64"/> in a way to make an eaſie Conqueſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhe Charmed him by her Beauty, inſomuch that becoming enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of her, which was her deſign, he was ſo far beſotted, that having drunk to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs becauſe of her preſence, and with an intention to defile her, he fell aſleep in his Tent, where being left alone with her according to his own Command, in order to the Accompliſhing of his Luſtful deſign ſhe had the opportunity of cutting off his head, and carrying it in Triumph to her City of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> upon which the Garriſon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Sally diſcomfited the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who were ſurprized at this ſtrange adventure that had befaln their General, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had not the Courage to make head againſt them. Whatever be the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this ſtory that may juſtly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the truth of it to be called in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, its plain from other paſſages which we ſhall have occaſion to touch in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this Hiſtory, that the diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a General hath oftener than once occaſioned the ruin of Armies.</p>
            <p>We come now to the ſtory of <hi>Suſanna</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This Woman, ſays the Author, was Wife to <hi>Joacim</hi> the Chief of the <hi>Jews</hi> then Captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Incomparable Beauty and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chaſtity. This Lady uſing to walk in her Husband's Garden in the afternoons, two of the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who attended at <hi>Joacim</hi>'s Houſe to execute Judgment, became inflam'd with Luſt towards her,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:110363:64"/> and tho' at firſt they were aſham'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to one another, yet afterwards being hardened in their Wickedneſs they plotted together againſt this Vertuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and watching an opportunity till they found her alone in the Garden, when ſhe had ſent her Maids out for Oil and Waſh-balls in order to bath her ſelf, they ſurpriz'd her, tempted her to Lewdneſs, and upon her refuſal accus'd her falſly as if they had taken her in Adultery with a young man, upon which ſhe was by the Authority of their Evidence Convicted and Condemned to die, but Juſt as ſhe was going to be put to death, the Lord rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſays the Author, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her, who obtaining that her Cauſe ſhould be reheard, he examined the Elders afreſh, and accuſing them of that Villainous and Luſtfull deſign againſt <hi>Suſanna,</hi> Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them of Perjury by their own Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the one of them ſaying they took her under a Maſtich, and the other ſaying that they took her under an Holm-Tree, ſo that they themſelves fell into the Pit which they had Digged for this Vertuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſuffered the puniſhment which they deſign'd ſhould have been inflicted upon her. Whether this ſtory be true or not is not material to our purpoſe, but in the proſecution of this deſign we ſhall meet with ſeveral parallell Inſtances which diſcover the thing not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in it ſelf, however improbable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its Circumſtances.</p>

            <p> We come now to the New Teſtament times, and find it obſervable that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in his firſt Sermon upon the Mount <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. inveighed againſt the impurity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who for light and frivolous Cauſes, ſuch as if they did not like their Wives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Divorced them, which was the occaſion of Uncleanneſs in themſelves and in the Women ſo Divorced, who, our Saviour ſays they cauſed to commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery if they put them away upon any other account than that of Fornication, ſo that 'tis plain that the Woman whom they took into their Bed in the room of her that was Divorced was no other than a Concubine, and that if the Woman ſo Divorced Married with another Man ſhe thereby became an Adultreſs as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour declares more at large in the 19th of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where we have an Account of the malice and ſubtlety of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> in propounding that Queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was Lawful for a Man to put away his Wife for every Cauſe:</hi> For if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had anſwered in the Affirmative, then they would have proclaimed him a Friend to Uncleanneſs, and if in the Negative then they would have oppoſed him with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but our Lord knowing their deſign referred them to the Creation, (when God made them Male and Female not Females, or diverſe Women for one Man) and to the firſt inſtitution of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which was only betwixt one and one, and therefore it was ſaid they two,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:110363:65"/> (not they three) four or five ſhall be one Fleſh, which clearly ſubverted all that could be alledged for Polygamy or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinage, and being the Commentary of the Lawgiver upon his own Law makes it of equal Authority with the Text, and ought for ever to ſhut the Mouths of ſuch as plead for a plurality of Wives.</p>
            <p>Then to their Argument from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he anſwers them that <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed permitted Divorces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the hardneſs of their Hearts, and to prevent a greater evil, as is Cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in all Political and Civil Conſtitutions, as if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, <hi>It's better that you put away your Wives when you grow weary of them than Murder them;</hi> and at the ſame time they were obliged to give them a Bill of Divorce which was a Teſtimony of the Woman's Innocence, and of the Husbands Levity and Impurity:—But our Saviour tells them that from the beginning it was not ſo, and that what God had joined no man could put aſunder; which was as much as to ſay that common Laws allow more than is allowed by the Laws of Religion, as is clear from this Inſtance that in all Chriſtian Kingdoms there are Judges Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for deciding differences betwixt Man and Man of what nature ſoever they may be, for preventing Oppreſſion and Injuſtice, ſo that the Bench is open to Trivial and Frivolous ſuits as well as to thoſe that are Weighty and Material; yet the practice of ſuch as go to Law upon every

It is alſo obſervable that our Saviour taught thoſe Phariſaical Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots who valued themſelves upon their external fanctity, a more refin'd and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of Chaſtity than they had formerly been acquainted with, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Law which forbad them to commit Adultery did not only reach the outward practice but the inward motions and thoughts of the heart, and therefore he tells them <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28. <hi>That whoſoever lookt on a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to Luſt after her hath committed Adultery with her already in his heart,</hi> a Doctrine which does ſo much Gall our Modern Gallants, <hi>That we have great reaſon to preſume it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We come next to the Hiſtorical paſſages of the new Teſtament, relating to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>The firſt we meet with is that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. concerning the Tetrarch <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias</hi> his Brother <hi>Philip</hi>'s Wife, with whom that Prince committed Inceſt, for which he was reproved by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> and this did ſo incenſe the wicked Woman that nothing leſs could expiate this ſuppoſed Crime of the Prophet than the loſs of his life, but ſhe durſt not attempt that raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for fear of the people, who as they knew her to be a Vicious Strumpet, did alſo know that <hi>John</hi> was a Good Man, and eſteem'd him as a Prophet; his Vertues being as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:110363:66"/> conſpicuous as her Vices, and therefore ſhe watch'd a convenient opportunity, which ſhe found on her Gallant <hi>Herod's</hi> Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, when he was feaſting and revelling with his Nobles, at which time ſhe ſent in her Daughter, the unworthy off-ſpring of ſuch an Ungodly Mother, to Dance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, wherewith <hi>Herod</hi> and his Company were ſo extreamly well pleas'd, that he raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vowed to grant her whatever ſhe would demand, and ſo the young Strumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuborn'd by the old one, demanded the Head of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> which <hi>Herod</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, tho' much againſt his Will, and ſhe carried it to her Mother in a Charger as an acceptable preſent, ſo naturally do Whoredom, Murder and Perſecution agree.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:110363:67"/> of the greateſt Villainy of other kinds, and juſtly given up of God to commit the ſame; for this Luſtful Prince having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted double Aduletry, a Rape and Inceſt, did afterwards commit two of the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Murders that ever were committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> our Saviours fore-runner, and then that of our Saviour himſelf; ſuch is the enmity which uncleanneſs does naturally lead men into againſt God and Good Men, and to be given up to that enmity is certainly the moſt dreadful of all puniſhments.</p>
            <p>The next thing that we meet with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to our Subject is the Inſtance of the Woman taken in Adultery, in the 8<hi>th chap.</hi> of the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John,</hi> and brought by the <hi>Phariſees</hi> before our Saviour, that by their enſnaring queſtions they might have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereof to accuſe him. Our Saviour knowing their wicked deſign, eluded them by ſtooping and writing upon the Ground. What it was that he then wrote is more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly than wiſely diſputed by the learned; ſome ſay that he wrote the words which he afterwards ſpoke to them, others, that he wrote theſe words, <hi>viz.

In the mean

               </gap> put to a nonplus, and knew not what to anſwer, did inſolently urge him to ſpeak, which he did to their Confuſion, by bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe that were without ſin throw the firſt Stone at her, with which they were ſo daunted and aſhamed, that they deſiſted from their accuſation, and went out one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, being convicted by their own Conſciences, that they were Guilty as well as ſhe; and found that neither their ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative nor private uncleanneſs were hid from our Saviour, who had formerly told them, that luſting after a Woman was Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in the Eyes of God; and it's probable did now point at their ſecret bodily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, when he commanded them that were Innocent to throw the firſt Stone at her, according to the practice of their own Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 7. which enjoyned the Witneſſes to lay their hands firſt upon the Head of the Perſon convicted by their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as a Teſtimony that they thought them worthy of Death, and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abhorred the Iniquity they were condemned for, whereas 'twas plain to our Saviour, that theſe Phariſees took care only to keep the outſide clean before Men, but had no regard to inward purity of mind, nor to common honeſty, ſo that they could but commit wickedneſs with ſecrecy and impunity; and thus they are accuſed by the God of Truth, as making long Prayers, and beſtowing publick Alms, while at the ſame time they devoured Widows' Houſes.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:110363:68"/>
            <p> The Phariſees being thus defeated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, the Woman is freed from all her Accuſers, upon which our Saviour asks her <hi>if no man had condemned her,</hi> and upon her anſwering no, and finding that all her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers were gone, he ſaid, <hi>neither do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee, go thy way and ſin no more.</hi> This anſwer of our Saviours hath been wreſted by ſome, as if he had thereby declared that Adultery was no capital crime under the Goſpel, whereas it is plain, that he only declined the part of a Magiſtrate and Judge; as he did in another Caſe, when one Brother deſired him to ſpeak to another, that he ſhould divide his Father's Eſtate with him: <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13. And therefore he only acts the part of a Miniſter, in exhorting the Woman to Repentance and Reformation, but no way extenuates her Crime: Nay, on the contrary, he ſeems directly to inſinuate that ſhe deſerved Condemnation, and would not have reproved any Judge if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned her; but his main deſign was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Hypocriſie of the Phariſees, who impoſed upon the people, as if they had been the moſt Juſt and upright ſort of men in the World, and as an Evidence of it, brought this perſon taken in <hi>flagranti delicto</hi> before him who was a Preacher of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to know what his opinion was concerning her puniſhment; and yet when he came to put the Queſtion home to their own Conſciences, whether they were not guilty of the ſame Crimes, and if they were not, bid them to proceed in the execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:110363:69"/> they went out one by one, which was as much as if they had made an open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Hypocriſie and Villainy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Spectators, which was partly evident before, in that they did not bring the Man as well as the Woman, which to be ſure they might have done, ſeeing the Criminals were taken in the Act, and they ought to have done it; ſeeing by the Law of God he was equally guilty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the whole, to form ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from this ſaying and practiſe of our Saviour, as that Adultery is not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able under the New Teſtament, is every whit as abſurd, as to ſay that becauſe he declined being a Judge betwixt two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, about the diviſion of their Father's Inheritance, therefore there ought to be no ſuch thing as a diviſion of Parents' Eſtates amongſt their Children under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Beſides 'tis apparent that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our Saviour's coming into the World was to ſave peoples' Souls, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Bodies; as is evident from his mercy to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom he caſt Seven unclean Devils; his Converſe with the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> whom he convinced of the Evil of her Way; and his permitting a Woman who was a ſinner, which in the New Teſtament Phraſe, is as much as a Common Proſtitute, to wipe his Feet whither Hair, and to waſh them with her Tears of Repentance.</p>

            <p> Theſe are all the Hiſtorical paſſages which we find relating to our Subject in the New Teſtament during Chriſt's abode upon Earth, and therefore we come next to a paſſage or two in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> ſuited to our purpoſe. The firſt is in his Antiquities, <hi>lib.</hi> 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. concerning <hi>Paulina</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, Wife to <hi>Saturninus</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon whom <hi>Decius Mundus</hi> another <hi>Roman</hi> of Quality became ſo enamoured, that he tempted her by Bribes and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther methods imaginable to comply with his luſtful deſign, offering her no leſs than 100000 <hi>Drachma's,</hi> which is computed at 6000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterlin, but ſhe would by no means conſent to him, whereupon he was ſo burnt up by his Luſt, that he pined and wither'd away daily, which being obſerved by <hi>Ida</hi> his Father's Servant Maid, ſhe learned his diſtemper, and undertook his Cure for 25000 <hi>Drachma's,</hi> which ſhe effected thus, ſhe underſtood that the Lady was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly addicted to the worſhip of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then God <hi>Iſis,</hi> who had a Temple at <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereupon applying her ſelf to the Prieſts, ſhe promis'd them 25000 <hi>Drachma's</hi> if they could ſo contrive it that <hi>Decius</hi> ſhould enjoy the Lady in the Temple; the one half in hand and the other upon the performance of the Bargain, the Prieſts undertook it, and laid the Plot in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner. The Eldeſt of them when the Lady came to the Temple accoſted her, and pretended that the God <hi>Anubis</hi> who frequented that Temple had conceiv'd
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:110363:70"/> a mighty paſſion for her, and earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her Company there one night, the Lady being charm'd with this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſort of Amour, being no leſs than a Divine Courtſhip as she thought, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Husband with it, who was as fond of being a Cukcold by an imaginary Deity, as ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> are at preſent by their <hi>Brachmans:</hi> And the reſt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ladys began to grudge at <hi>Paulina</hi>'s good Luck, and to long for the like. The appointed time being come, <hi>Paulina</hi> makes haſte to the Temple, where the Roguish Prieſts had <hi>Decius</hi> ready, who aſſoon as the Lamps were removed approach'd to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Paulina;</hi> and under the notion of the God <hi>Anubis</hi> debauch'd her without any reſiſtance. The deluded Lady, returned in the Morning highly honoured as she thought; but <hi>Decius</hi> meeting her a little after, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his former ſuit, which she rejected as uſual, whereupon he told her in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding manner, that she was not ſo coy the other night in the Temple of <hi>Iſis,</hi> where he enjoy'd her for one fourth of the Sum that he had formerly proffered her: The poor Lady being ſurprized to find that she had entertained a lewd Adulterer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a ſuppoſed Divinity, tore her hair, rent her cloaths, and diſcovered the Cheat to her Husband, who complaining thereof to the Emperor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> he condemn'd the Prieſts and <hi>Ida</hi> to be hang'd, ordered the Temple to be pull'd down, the Statue of <hi>Anubis</hi> to be thrown into the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:110363:70"/> 
               <hi>Decius Mundus</hi> to be banish'd,—and thus this Famous Temple was demolish'd, and the Convent of Prieſts deſtroyed, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pimps to the inſatiable Luſt of a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> he himſelf baniſh'd from his Country, which he had polluted, and <hi>Ida</hi> his Bawd pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd as all others of the Trade ought to be.</p>
            <p>That ſame Author in the 18<hi>th</hi> Book in his Antiquities and the 12<hi>th</hi> Chapter, gives us another account of a Tragedy brought upon a great number of his Countrymen, by an unlawful Amour, as follows. <hi>Anilae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Aſinaeus</hi> two <hi>Jews</hi> of mean Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon a diſguſt retired into an Iſland of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where joyning with other diſſolute perſons and vagabond <hi>Jews,</hi> they became formidable to the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which they ravaged at their pleaſure, and ſo increaſing in number, were a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the Princes of thoſe Countries, and obliged them to court their friendſhip; but having once relax'd the diſcipline that they obſerv'd when they firſt form'd themſelves into a Society, they loſt ground, and <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> luſting after a <hi>Parthian</hi> Lady, made War againſt her Husband, upon her account, and was ſo bewitch'd with her Amours, that he countenanc'd Idolatry for her ſake, which bred diſcontent amongſt his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, moſt of which were <hi>Jews,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining thereof to <hi>Aſinaeus</hi> his Brother, he reprov'd him for it, upon which the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Lady poyſon'd <hi>Aſinaeus;</hi> but the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God ſoon overtook them, for <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> taking Arms againſt <hi>Anilaeus</hi> and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:110363:71"/> his diſſolute Companions, he defeated them in Battle, and afterwards the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Syrians,</hi> who liv'd in <hi>Seleucia</hi> kill'd 50,000 of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuch was the fatal Conſequence of Whoredom and Idolatry, which did firſt mutually produce one another, and then both together iſſued in the deſtruction of their followers.</p>
            <p>The laſt inſtance that we meet with in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> for our purpoſe is that in the 5th Book of his Wars and 9th. Chapter, where he gives us an account that during the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus</hi> the Son of <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian,</hi> the Faction called the Zealots <hi>became Luſtful, Effeminate, Laſcivious, Curl'd their Hair, wore Women's Apparel, anointed themſelves that their Beautymight be pleaſing, thirſted after <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural pleaſures, and made</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a Stews and not long after followed the utter deſtruction of their City, Temple and Commonwealth, with the ſlaughter of</hi> 1,100,000 <hi>of their people,</hi> ſince which they have been Vagabonds, a Curſe and a Reproach upon the face of Earth, and are noted for a Luſtfull and Unclean People where ever they are, God having in his Juſt Judgment giv'n them up to work all manner of Uncleanneſs with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, ſeeing their Love to their Luſts made them firſt reject the Pure and Holy Doctrine of our Saviour, and afterwards Crucify him, which is another Inſtance to confirm what has been ſo often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, that ſuch Perſons or people as wallow in their Luſts want only an Opportunity and Tentation to declare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:110363:71"/> War againſt God and Religion, which always iſſues in their own Confuſion if their Converſion don't prevent it.</p>
            <p>We have often had occaſion to obſerve that Whoredome hath been productive of Idolatry, and in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> we have the Authority of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle for it, that Idolatry hath been the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Uncleanneſs, <hi>Vice Verſa,</hi> where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe that when they knew God by the light of nature and the works of Creation <hi>Yet becauſe they Glorified him not as God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were thankful but became vain in their Imaginations, their fooliſh heart was darkned, and profeſſing themſelves to be Wiſe they became Fools, and changing the Glory of the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible God into an Image,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore God alſo gave them up to Vile Affections and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, thro' the Luſts of their own hearts to diſhonour their own Bodies, between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For even their Women changed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural uſe into that which is againſt Nature, and likewiſe alſo the men leaving the natural uſe of the Women, burned in their Luſt one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another, Men with Men working that which is unſeemly, receiving in themſelves that recompenſe of their error which was meet; and as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a Reprobate mind to do thoſe things which are not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, being filled with all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p> What the Apoſtle ſays of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s arriving to a great height of the knowledge of God by the light of nature, and the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is evident by many Inſtances, but by none more than that of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who, tho' a Heathen, hath writ more true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity than almoſt all thoſe Chriſtian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have done, who are known by the name of Schoolmen. <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Socrates</hi> and others are alſo ſtrong proofs of this, but notwithſtanding all their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they were vain in their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thinking themſelves Wiſe became Fools, and ſo not only they themſelves but the Heathens who had the benefit of their Lectures conceiving falſe notions of the Deity which every one of 'em would adapt to their own Fancies, they were given up of God to all manner of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and thence it came to paſs that the Ancients talkt ſo many obſcene things concerning the Yard of <hi>Priapus,</hi> one of their Heathen Divinities, and Son to <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> in reality a Vile Drunken De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht Stallion, whoſe virile parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Extroardinary Size, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Debaucht Women did continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally haunt him, ſo that the Magiſtrates of the Town where he liv'd were forced to baniſh him, whereupon ſay the Poets <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> plagu'd them, ſo that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to build him a Temple and in their ſolemnities they carried about a ſtick in reſemblance of his Yard—Of the ſame

Naturae Muliebris Imago,</hi> which tho' all that were admitted to them were ſworn to conceal, yet the ſagacity of the primitive Chriſtians found it out. At theſe Ceremonies the Women uſed to ride in Carts and abuſe one another with profane and ſcurrilous Language, fit indeed for Carted Whores, whence came the <hi>Proverb
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:110363:73"/> De plauſtro loqui.</hi> This Ceremony was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in remembrance of <hi>Ceres</hi> ſeeking for her Daughter <hi>Proſerpina</hi> whom the Poets fancy <hi>Pluto</hi> raviſhed and carried to <hi>Hell.</hi> And ſuch was the Hypocriſie of thoſe who had the Conduct and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe ſolemnities, that tho' they knew the thing to be profane in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, yet one of the four preſidents that aſſiſted the King during the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had the Impudence to run about and cry <hi>procul hinc, procul ite profani, i. e.</hi> ſtand off and begone all profane Perſons as is related by <hi>Marcrobius, Tertullian, Heſychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Athenaeus</hi> and others. Such was the madneſs and wickedneſs of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> at that time the moſt polite and learned people in the world; and who valued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much upon their Learning and Philoſophy, that they called all the reſt of the World <hi>Barbarians,</hi> accounted the Goſpel fooliſhneſs, and lookt upon the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to be a Babbler.

            <p>Parallell to this is the horrid impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Popiſh Church and Clergy, which was much more open and notorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation: the <hi>Rabbi</hi>'s of that Church affecting to be wiſe above what is Written, and Introducing not only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of an ordinary ſize, but alſo downright Idolatry, as the Invocation and Adoration of Saints and Angels, God did Juſtly give them up to all manner of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, notwithſtanding their monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal vows and pretended Celibacy, that they became the ſcandal of Chriſtianity, their Monaſteries Bawdy-Houſes, and at laſt a Butcher's Shambles by murdering thoſe Infants which they had ſpuriouſly begot, as was evident to the World by the great quantities of Childrens Skulls and other Bones which were found in their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, upon their diſſolution in thoſe Countries where the Reformation obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

            <p> And it is alſo plain beyond all Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that thoſe who embrace the Old <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie, now revived under the name of <hi>Socinianiſm, Deiſm, &amp;c.</hi> Have reaſon to look upon the diſſolute lives of moſt of their Fraternity in this Nation as a Juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them from God for growing vain in their Imaginations, and rejecting all thoſe principles of Religion which they cannot Fathom with their ſhallow and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted reaſon.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen under what ſevere Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Chaſtity was enjoyn'd unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> who under the Old Teſtament were the peculiar people and Church of God; and with what tremendous Judgments thoſe who violated that Law were from time to time purſued. We have alſo heard out Saviour's Expoſition of the 7th. Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and how it reaches the Motions and Affections of the Soul as well as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal act, and it hath been Proved by Divine Authority that the giving of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or People up to Uncleanneſs is a Juſt Judgment of God for having forſaken him. So that now it remains that we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in what manner, and under what Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties Chaſtity is enjoyn'd to Chriſtians under the new Teſtament. We find then in the 15 of the <hi>Acts, v.</hi> 20. That For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications was one of the things which the firſt Synodical Meeting or General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Chriſtian Church forbid, by the Authority of the Holy Ghoſt, by which Interpreters underſtand that not only Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:110363:74"/> within prohibited degrees, but Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſingle Fornication and keeping of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, or to uſe the term now in faſhion <hi>keeping of Miſſes</hi> was forbid, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why that manifeſt violation of the Laws of Nature, Creation, and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is mixt with thoſe things which were Temporary, as the abſtaining from Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was becauſe the Gentiles, eſpecially the people of the Eaſt were very much addicted to Uncleanneſs, and Cuſtom had prevailed ſo much amongſt 'em, that they ſcarcely thought Fornication or the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Concubine any ſin: And that it's plain, that this firſt Oecumenical Council if we may ſo venture to call it, did not deſign this of Fornication as a Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prohibition only, will appear by the repeated injunctions and prohibitions of the Apoſtles throughout their Epiſtles, and the Sentence of excluſion from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, which from time to time they pronounce againſt Whoredom. Thus in the 6th. of <hi>Romans v.</hi> 19. <hi>He tells them that as they had yielded their Members Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, ſo now they were to yield their Members Servants unto Holineſs.</hi> Chap. 8. 7. He tells them, <hi>That if they live after the Fleſh they ſhall die.</hi> Chap. 13. 13, 14. <hi>We are forbid to walk in Chambering and Wantonneſs, or to make proviſion for the fleſh to fullfill the Luſts thereof;</hi> the Reading of which latter Verſe, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by a Voice when walking in his Garden, which bid him <hi>take up the Bible and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:110363:75"/> read,</hi> and falling upon that Text he was thereby converted, he having been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much given to Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>Then in 1 <hi>Cor. Chap.</hi> 5. he ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cenſured the inceſtuous Perſon who was one of their Members, tho' guilty of ſuch a ſort of Fornication as was not ſo much as named amongſt the Gentiles, <hi>viz</hi> That one ſhould have his Father's Wife, not that never any ſuch thing was com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted amongſt the Gentiles, for Hiſtory teaches us the contrary; but when it did happen it was never ſpoken of nor menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned without horror, and was always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as Monſtrous and Ominous: And therefore to take away the ſcandal from the Chriſtian Church, the Apoſtle Orders him to be delivered up to Satan, <hi>i. e.</hi> Excommunicated, and caſt out of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Church, by which Cenſure he was thrown out of the Kingdom of Chriſt as an Exile, and by Conſequence deprived of his protection, by which he became; Subject or rather a Slave to Satan, the God of this World, there being no <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> betwixt thoſe two, of being either a Subject of Chriſt or a Subject of Satan, and therefore he who is caſt out of the Church <hi>clave non errante,</hi> may very we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l be ſaid to be delivered up to Satan. It's true there are ſome, who think that by theſe words was meant a delivering of him up to Satan to be tormented by ſome bodily diſtemper, but that Expoſition is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:110363:75"/> too much forced to be relied on. In the 9th. and 11th. Verſes of that Chapter the Apoſtle forbids <hi>them ſo much as to eat with a Brother who is a Fornicator,</hi> ſuch was the purity of Life that the Holy Ghoſt enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>In the 6th. Chap. the Apoſtle informs us <hi>That neither Fornicators nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> and by Conſequence we may Judge that they were neither fit to be Members of Churches, nor indeed of Politick and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Societes with Chriſtians. In the 11 Verſe, he tells <hi>them ſuch were ſome of you, but now ye are Sanctified.</hi> v. 13. <hi>He ſays that the body is not for Fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the Body.</hi> And in the 15, and 16. v. argues againſt Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from the abſurdity of it in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who thereby <hi>made their bodies that are Members of Chriſt Members of an Harlot,</hi> which was as much as to ſay that you cannot make Chriſt a partaker of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with you, and therefore when you are guilty of thoſe abominable ſins you diſunite your ſelf from Chriſt, and offer violence to your own bodies by pulling your ſelf away from Chriſt, and joining your ſelf to an Harlot.</p>
            <p>In the 18th. Verſe he enjoins them to flee Fornication, becauſe <hi>He that committeth Fornication ſinneth againſt his own Body,</hi> that is, in a ſpecial manner, he diſhonoureth his Body by making it a Member of an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:110363:76"/> and diſuniting it from Chriſt; he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Body which the Holy Ghoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth not to chuſe for a Temple a Cage of Unclean ſpirits, and ſo provoketh the Holy ſpirit to abandon it, who will not dwell in an Impure place, and as Whoredom brings a more direct blemiſh upon the body than any other ſin doth, ſo it tends to the diſſolution and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the frame of the Body.</p>
            <p>In the 7th. Chapter, the Apoſtle treats of Marriage as a proper Remedy againſt Fornication, and therefore neceſſary and commendable, not that it was Originally inſtituted as a Remedy againſt Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it was appointed in Paradiſe, during the State of Innocence, when there was no ſuch thing as Fornication; but it became neceſſary for that end ſince the fall, and therefore as propagation was the primary end of Marriage, the avoiding of Fornication became a Secondary end—The reaſon of the Apoſtles inſiſting upon this, is in the opinion of Commentators, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were ſome among the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> to whom he wrote, who Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting Chaſtity deſpiſed Marriage, and fell into hurtfull and filthy Luſts; and others again under pretence of Chaſtity pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſſolve their Marraige Contract, and put away their Wives, that they might attend with more diligence and aſſiduity upon the Service of God, and therefore to obviate both thoſe abſurd opinions he ſhews the neceſſity and ſanctity of a marriage
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:110363:76"/> ſtate, tho' he owns that in conſideration of the then troubleſome times, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions which attended the Church, it was better for thoſe Chriſtians who had the Gift of Continency not to marry than to encumber themſelves with Families, and the neceſſary cares of providing for a Family, which do always follow upon Marriage; but at the ſame time he tells them that 'tis better to Marry than to Burn, and recalls Marriage to its Primitive inſtitution in the 2d. Verſe, thus, <hi>Let every Man have his own Wife, and let every Woman have her own Husband:</hi> By which he expreſly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns Digamy and Polygamy.—And then he tells them the duty of Married Perſons that tho' they might for a time abſtain from the Marriage-Bed by mutual conſent, in order to give themſelves to faſting and prayer, yet they were <hi>not to defrand one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but to come together again,</hi> leſt Satan, the Author of all Uncleanneſs, ſhou'd tempt them for their Incontinence, ſo that by this Chapter it is plain, that that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy which the Romiſh Clergy pretend to obſerve is none of God's appointment, and therefore 'tis not to be wondred at, that they who have ſo contemptuouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Sacred ordinance of Marriage ſhould be given up to thoſe Brutiſh Luſts which have made them the ſcandal of the Chriſtian World. The Holy <hi>Paphnutius</hi> when it was moved in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> that the Clergy ſhould abſtain from their Wives, oppoſed it by his Authority, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:110363:77"/> by the Apoſtles' Authority, telling 'em that Marriage was honourable, and that a Man's lying with his own Wife was no breach of Chaſtity, upon which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil commended his opinion, and ordain'd nothing in that affair as we are told by <hi>Sozomen Hiſt. Tripartit. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 14. So that the Canon which is now numbred amongſt thoſe of that Council, forbidding the Marriage of the Clergy, is with good reaſon lookt upon as ſuppoſititious.</p>
            <p>In the 5th. of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> v. 19. the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That the Works of the fleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Verſe, he tells us that they that are Chriſt's have Crucified the fleſh with the Affections and Luſts, ſo that thoſe who wallow in ſuch Impurities let 'em call themſelves or be called by others what they pleaſe, 'its plain that they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their Title to the name of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>In the 2d. of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he reckons thoſe <hi>who walk in the Luſts of the fleſh, and fullfill the deſires thereof amongſt the Children of wrath and diſobedience who walk according to the Prince of the power of the Air.</hi> Our Luſtfull Gallants and Beaus would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to run any man thro' the Lungs who ſhould call them Children of the Devil, and yet they are called ſuch in expreſs terms by the Holy Ghoſt; ſo that it's not to be wondred at that they do ſo much ſpurn at all revealed Religion.</p>

            <p> In the 4th.

            <p>In the 11th. of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and 16th. verſe he warns them to <hi>take heed that there be no Fornicator nor Profane Perſon amongſt them like</hi> Eſau, <hi>who ſold his Birth-right for one Morſel,</hi> Perſons who are addicted to their Luſts being ready at any time to ſell their

            <p>It is fit alſo to be obſerved here, that the Papiſts and other Sects who forbid or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the uſe of Marriage were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto prompted at firſt by a falſe ſhew of Purity and Sanctity, which demonſtrates how abominable they reckoned the ſin of Uncleanneſs, when they thought that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Society rendered men unfit for their Devotions, but their unhappy miſtake was attended with miſchievous Conſequences, for inſtead of that purity which they aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by diſpiſing Marriage which is of Divine inſtitution, they fell into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Uncleanneſs as is known to thoſe who have read the Hiſtories of the <hi>Encratites, Marcionites, Fatians, Manichees, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Vitious Practiſes as to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Popiſh Monks have ſerv'd themſelves heirs to, and therefore cannot avoid fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under the reach of that Propheſie, 1ſt. of <hi>Timothy</hi> and 4th. tho' they have ſtrain'd their Wits toward it off from themſelvs.</p>

            <p>Some will have all that is writ of the <hi>Amazons</hi> to be a meer Fable, and others, that all the ſtories of them was occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Women's bearing Arms, and Fighting in Battle as well as the Men; and it may be, being more numerous in diverſe of thoſe Battles, than the Men who were either abſent or conſumed in thoſe Expeditions, they had the Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as is obſerved by <hi>Juan Orelhan</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> who diſcovered that great River, call'd by the Name of the River of the <hi>Amazons</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> upon the Banks of which he perceived the Women in Arms to exceed the men in number, and to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, and upon that Account he gave the Name aforeſaid to that River.</p>
            <p>But however the matter be, it affords us this Obſervation, that all Kingdoms and States ought to take care of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Marriage; and to avoid as much as may be the Exhauſting of their Men by Wars, Colonies or Conqueſts,

            <p>Before we come to give an Account how the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy was overturn'd by Luxury and Laſciviouſneſs, we ſhall have occaſion to touch upon ſome Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Revolutions, occaſioned amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> by Uncleanneſs. The firſt that we meet with in <hi>Juſtin</hi> is that of <hi>Diocles</hi> King or Governour of <hi>Athens,</hi> who having forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a young Woman, he was in Revenge thereof killed by her Brother, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Hippias</hi> Brother to <hi>Diocles</hi> ordered the youngman to be apprehended, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him upon the Rack, examined him concerning thoſe that were privy to his deſign, the young man in further Revenge for this new Injury, Nam'd all the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant's Friends, who being put to Death upon his Accuſation, <hi>Hippias</hi> ask'd if he knew of any more that were Conſcious to his Crime.

                  </gap>ns</hi> againſt his own Country was ſlain in Battle. And here it's proper to add that the effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:110363:84"/> and Luxury of the <hi>Perſians</hi> under the Reign <hi>Xerxes,</hi> was the chief cauſe of the ſhamefull overthrows which they received by the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Remarkable inſtance which we find for our purpoſe in <hi>Juſtin,</hi> is that in his 3d. Book of the War betwixt the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemoonians,</hi> occaſioned by the former's having Raviſhed the Virgins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the latter, whilſt they were at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, upon which the <hi>Lacedomineans</hi> bound themſelves by a ſolemn Oath never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into their Country till they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Meſſenia,</hi> which laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Inteſtine Diſcord, and Civil War in <hi>Grecia</hi>—The Siege of this Town continued 10 years, during which time the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Women being not able to brook the want of their Husbands Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they ſent heavy complaints to them upon that head, but the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to violate their Oaths, and at the ſame time ſenſible that their people muſt needs decreaſe, they fell upon this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> to ſend home all the young men who had come as Recruits to their Camp af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking of the ſaid Oath, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them the Liberty to Accompany with the Women, the Children begot by this promiſcuous Copulation, were as a Brand of their Mothers' Infamy called <hi>Parthenii,</hi> and arriving at the Age of 30, they were ſo much afraid of coming to Want, becauſe they knew not whom to call Father, nor which way to have any Patrimony, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:110363:85"/> under the Conduct of <hi>Phalantus</hi> Son to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi> who was the Author of the Advice to ſend the young men from the Camp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſaid, they reſolved to ſeek new Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations for themſelves, and ſo without ſo much as ſaluting or taking leave of their Mothers, from whom they deriv'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of being Baſtards, they arriv'd at laſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſubdued the <hi>Tarentines,</hi> and ſettled in their Country. But to return to the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> they were at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> in two Wars, the 1ſt. of 20 and the 2. of 14 years contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, and reduced to a miſerable ſlavery, which was originally occaſion'd as we have juſt now heard by their Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>Our next Inſtance is in <hi>Juſtin Lib.</hi> 5: concerning <hi>Timea</hi> Queen to <hi>Agis</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> who being guilty of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with <hi>Alcibiades</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> while an Exile from his Country at her Husband's Court, ſhe diſcovered to him the deſign which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had againſt his Life, becauſe they envied his Conduct and Glory, upon which <hi>Alcibiades</hi> fled to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and having by his cunning prevail'd with the <hi>Athenians</hi> to recall him, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards defeated the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> by Sea and Land, and brought them to ſue for Peace, ſo deſtructive to her Country was the Unlawfull Amours of this Whoriſh Queen, and ſo ruinous to the whole Eaſt, and particularly to <hi>Athens</hi> was the Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Luſtfull Temper of <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of whoſe Exile as above mentioned
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:110363:85"/> was his diſcovery of ſomething of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Ceres</hi>'s Worſhip, or the Profane <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina Sacra,</hi> which we have already deſcribed at large. The fatal <hi>Exit</hi> of this Great Man is alſo Remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the 30 Tyrants burnt in his Chamber when aſleep; a ſuitable puniſhment from the hand of Divine Juſtice for one that had burnt in impure Luſt, however he deſerved better Treatment at the hands of his Country.</p>
            <p>That ſame Author in his ſixth Book, acquaints us that after the death of <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> the great <hi>Theban</hi> General, the <hi>Athenians</hi> having no Enemy to whet their Emulation or Exerciſe their Martial Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, grew Luxurious and Debauch'd, ſpent their Time and Revenues in publick Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals and Plays, frequented the Stage and Play-Houſes more than the Camp, and did more extoll their Poets and Orators than their Captains and Generals; by which means they loſt their Glory, and rendred themſelves and all <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> a prey to the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> formerly an obſcure people.</p>
            <p>Before we go any further in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Unlawful Amours of <hi>Greece</hi> it may not be improper to take notice of the ruine of <hi>Troy</hi> by the <hi>Graecians,</hi> after ten years War upon the account of the Rape of fair <hi>Helena</hi> from <hi>Menelaus</hi> a <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Prince, by <hi>Paris</hi> Son to <hi>Priamus</hi> King of <hi>Troy.</hi> This ſtory being known to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry School-Boy, its needleſs to inſiſt upon it, but we ſhall only obſerve that the Luſt of <hi>Paris</hi> occaſioned the ruin of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:110363:86"/> and City about the year of the World 2870. after it had ſtood near 296 years.

               <hi>Juſtin</hi> in his 7th. Book gives us this Remarkable inſtance of puniſhment infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ambaſſadors for their Lechery, <hi>viz.</hi> That being ſent by <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> General to demand Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages from <hi>Amyntas</hi> King of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> that Prince received them kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Ambaſſadors having drank largely in the time of the Feaſt, ſo as their Luſt was inflamed, they demanded that they might have the Company of the Kings Wives and Daughters at their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they ſaid was a Pledge of Hoſpitality among the <hi>Perſians.</hi> The King thinking ſit to grant it, the <hi>Perſians</hi> began to handle the Women immodeſtly, upon which <hi>Alexander</hi> Son to King <hi>Amyntas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd his Father to withdraw from the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet becauſe of his Age and Gravity, the Prince having done ſo, <hi>Alexander</hi> a little while after called out the Women, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that he would bring them back in a better dreſs, that ſo they might be the more acceptable to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and in their place brought in as many young Men in Womens Habit with orders to puniſh the Ambaſſadors for their laſciviouſneſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:110363:86"/> when they begun to handle them as they had done the Women, the young men kill'd every one of the Ambaſſadors with Swords which they had concealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Garments.</p>
            <p>In that ſame Book we have an inſtance of an abominable Inceſtuous Intrigue of <hi>Eurydice</hi> Wife to another <hi>Amyntas</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and Nephew to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who falling in Love with her Son-in-Law, upon promiſe of Marriage under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to murder her Husband and advance her Gallant to the Throne, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by her Daughter who diſcovered her Mother's Inceſt and bloody deſign, yet <hi>Amyntas</hi> for the Love which he bare to the Children that he had by this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Woman ſpar'd her, and the Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Beaſt after his Death murdered her own Sons <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Perdiccas</hi> by him, tho' for their ſakes he had ſpared her Life; and all this miſchief ſhe committed, that ſhe might wallow without Interruption in her Impure Luſts.</p>
            <p>In his 9th Book he gives us an account of the death of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi>

               </gap>ather to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great, which was occaſioned partly by his having Divorc'd <hi>Olympias,</hi> on ſuſpicion of Adultery, or with an Adulterous deſign to marry <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and partly becauſe he had not executed Judſtice upon <hi>Attalus</hi> for having Committed <hi>Sodomy</hi> upon <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias,</hi> who frequently complained of it, but was always diſmiſs'd with ſcorn, and therefore watching his Opportunity he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:110363:87"/> ſtabb'd <hi>Philip</hi> on the day that he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> as walking betwixt his own Sons, afterwards <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great and <hi>Alexander</hi> his Son-in-Law. Thus this Great Prince who had Conquer'd many Nations and Countries, became a Conqueſt and Victim to his own Luſts and the Luſts of others, and occaſioned likewiſe the death of his Paramour <hi>Cleopatra, Olympias</hi> having firſt murdered her Daughter, and then forc'd <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to hang her ſelf.</p>
            <p>His 10th. Book furniſhes us with a very remarkable inſtance of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who had 115 ſome ſay 160 Sons by Concubines, and three only by Lawfull Marriage, for which Incontinence he was puniſh'd in the following manner; his Son <hi>Darius</hi> being by the Indulgence of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> admitted to the Throne while he himſelf was alive, contrary to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he ungratefully Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt his Father's Life, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged 49 of his Brethren in the Conſpiracy. The occaſion of this Unnatural Plot was yet more vile than the Plot it ſelf, which <hi>Juſtin</hi> relates thus, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and killed his Brother <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the War betwixt them, he married <hi>Aſpaſia Cyrus</hi> his Concubine, and her <hi>Darius</hi> wou'd have his Father to reſign to him as well as his Throne, which the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Father promiſed to do at firſt, but repenting of it afterwards, he made her prieſteſs to the Sun that he might have a fair pretence of denying her to <hi>Darius,</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:110363:87"/> becauſe according to the <hi>Perſian</hi> ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thoſe of that Office muſt obſerve perpetual Chaſtity. <hi>Darius</hi> taking this as a great affront, entred into the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy as abovementioned, which being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the Inceſtuous and Unnatural Traitor with all his Aſſociates, their Wives and Children was cut off, that there might be no memorial left of ſuch a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid piece of Villainy. Thus was Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs juſtly puniſh'd both in Father and Children, and this Inſtance is ſo much the more remarkable that it fell out but a few years before the overthrow of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, which the Laſciviouſneſs and Effeminacy of the <hi>Perſians</hi> made eaſy to be effected.</p>
            <p>Our next inſtance is <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who tho' in the height of his Youth and Conqueſts, he obtain'd ſo much Glory by abſtaining from <hi>Darius</hi> his Beautiful Queen and Daughters who were his Captives, yet giving himſelf afterwards up to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Pleaſures, he hath thereby rendred his Infamy as Immortal as his Fame. It's obſerved of him by his Hiſtorian <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> that he was always more Famous in War than after Victory, and that having broke the Power of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire he degenerated into thoſe very Manners or rather Vices, which made the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſuch an eaſie Conqueſt to him. That ſame Author in his 5th. Book gives us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that <hi>Alexander</hi> having ſtaid much longer at <hi>Babylon</hi> than he did at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:110363:88"/> place, the Corrupt Manners of the Citizens did more prejudice to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline of his Army than any thing they had met with before that time; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Deſcription that <hi>Curtius</hi> gives us of the abominable Luxury and Impurity which reign'd in that City, is ſufficient to convince us that the Empire of which that was the Metropolis, or at leaſt the moſt Renowned and Greateſt City, was ripe for ruin. The words of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian are as follow, <hi>There was nothing more corrupt than the manners of that City, and nothing more Accommodated to incite and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Voluptuouſneſs and Luſt.

            <p>Our Author gives us another Inſtance of the Idleneſs and Luxury of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Women, <hi>viz. That when</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great had received Purple and</hi> Macedonian <hi>Apparel made by his own Siſters in a Preſent from home, be ordered the ſame to be Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to</hi> Syſigambis <hi>the Mother of</hi> Darius, <hi>with this Complement, that if ſhe lik'd them he would ſurniſh her with thoſe who ſhou'd teach her Grand Daughters to make ſuch, which preſently drew Tears from the</hi> Perſian <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, there being nothing reckon'd more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable amongſt the</hi> Perſian <hi>Women than to Card and Spin,</hi> which I take to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Author's words <hi>to touch Wool.</hi> How much this differs from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a good Houſwife, and whether the handling of Wool had not been more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable than ſuch Diſſolute Revels as we juſt now mentioned, let the World judge. But to return to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great.</p>
            <p>After he had with great difficulty and danger paſt the ſtraits of <hi>Suſis,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Perſepolis</hi> the Royal Reſidence of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Laſcivious Inhabitants became Executioners of Divine Juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves and their Impure City, for putting on their chief Ornaments of which their Luxury had made them provide a great Number, they threw themſelves their Wives and Children headlong from the Walls and precipices, and ſet fire to their own Houſes: But that which is particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:110363:89"/> as to <hi>Alexander,</hi> is that in a Drunken fit at the perſwaſion of <hi>Thais</hi> a Drunken Whore, ſays <hi>Curtius, he ordered the Famous Royal Palace of the</hi> Perſian <hi>Kings to be burnt, which he had hitherto ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and he himſelf threw the firſt firebrand into it to his perpetual Ignominy and Diſgrace,</hi> However, we may plainly ſee by this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that the ſin of the <hi>Perſians</hi> was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in their puniſhment, when this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Palace that had been polluted with ſuch Herds of Strumpets, as the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings did uſually Entertain, was burnt to Aſhes at the inſtigation of an Infamous Strumpet, and not long after <hi>Darius</hi> himſelf fell by the hands of his Treacherous Subjects, which put an end to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curtius</hi> in his 6th. Book gives us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how <hi>Alexander</hi> became hate full to the Graver ſort of his Captains and Generals by his degenerating into the Vices of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> as, Immoderate drinking, and ſpending his time in Plays, and amongſt Herds of Strumpets, which occaſioned fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Conſpiracies againſt him, Mutinies amongſt his Souldiers; and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions. He became likewiſe guilty of <hi>Sodomy</hi> with <hi>Bagoas, Darius</hi>'s Ennueh, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the <hi>Perſian</hi> Habit and Cuſtoms, and entertained 360 Concubines as <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had done before him, which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to grumble, and ſay, That he was more like to thoſe that he had Conquer'd than a Conqueror, ſo that he was forc'd, to prevent their ſedition, to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:110363:89"/> engage them in a freſh War, after he had for thirteen days ſatiated his Luſt with <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> Queen of the <hi>Amazons</hi> at her own deſire. While he was preparing for his Expedition againſt <hi>Beſſus, Philotas</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Great Officers conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Life, but <hi>Nicomachus</hi> a Catamite having diſcovered it by means of <hi>Dima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> who was his Companion in that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Amour, revealed it ſo as 'twas prevented, but it coſt his Villainous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour <hi>Dimachus</hi> and others their Lives; ſuch was the fatal Conſequence of <hi>Dimachus</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Luſt to himſelf and others.</p>
            <p>The next Inſtance which <hi>Curtius</hi> affords fit for our purpoſe, is that of <hi>Spitamenes,</hi> who being Prince or Governor of the People called <hi>Dahee,</hi> he revolted from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> and doting upon his Beautifull Wife, carried her with him where-ever he went, ſhe being weary of that kind of Life, adviſed him to ſubmit himſelf to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi> which he took ſo ill, that he upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with a luſtfull deſign, thinking that her Beauty would make her acceptable to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and therefore would have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her if he had not been hindred by thoſe about him; whereupon he forbad her to come any more into his preſence, and that he might wean him-ſelf from her, he paſs'd his time amongſt his Concubines; but finding that he could not Conquer his paſſion towards her, he ſent for her again, and ſhe pretending to have forgot her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Injury, watch'd her opportunity when
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:110363:90"/> he was faſt aſleep and cutting off his Head, took one Servant along with her, and carried it to <hi>Alexander,</hi> which proves that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's ſuſpicion of her was not ill found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but <hi>Alexander</hi> tho' he was glad to be rid of ſuch a troubleſome Enemy as <hi>Spita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> did ſo much abhor the Barbarous and Treacherous Woman, that he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to depart the Camp, leſt the <hi>Graecian</hi> Women ſhould be infected by her curſed Example. Thus was <hi>Spitamenes</hi> and ſhe both juſtly puniſhed for their Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curtius</hi> in his 8th. Book gives us another Inſtance of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s being Conquered by his Luſts, which was thus. <hi>Cohortanes</hi> the Governor of a certain Country, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſubmitted himſelf to <hi>Alexander,</hi> he did likewiſe entertain him with a Feaſt, and for his better diverſion ordered 30 Noble Virgins to be brought in, amongſt whom was his own Daughter <hi>Roxane,</hi> a Lady of Incomparable Beauty; with whom <hi>Alexander</hi> (who had abſtain'd from <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s fair Wife, and two Daughters, all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of much Greater Beauty and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) was ſo much taken, that in the heat of his Luſt he Contracted a Marriage with this Comparatively Ignoble Lady, to the Great diſguſt of his Friends.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Book he gives us a lively Deſcription of the Effeminacy and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who Inhabited about the <hi>Ganges</hi> and <hi>Dyardenes,</hi> that were ſome of the laſt of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Conqueſts, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:110363:90"/> indeed Ripe for ſuch Judgments as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt Generally brings upon a Nation. <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> Expreſſes himſelf Elegantly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Luxury of their Kings which they call Magnificence exceeds the Vices of all other Nations, they never come abroad but their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants carry Silver Cenſers and Perfume all the way that the Prince is to go. He is carried in a Golden Couch hung about with Jewels—This Chair or Couch is followed by his Guards, who carry Branchés of Trees with Singing-Birds and Parrots up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; his Palace is ſupported by Gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Columns, and they adorn'd with Vines inlaid with Gold, and the Effigies of ſuch Birds upon them in Silver as they do moſt delight in. When the King Combs and Dreſſes his Hair, then he gives Audience to Ambaſſadors and does Juſtice to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his Shooes or Sandals being taken off, his Feet are Anointed and Perfum'd with precious Ointments and Perfumes; his greateſt Labour is Hunting, and that is to ſhoot Darts at Birds and Beaſts penn'd up in a Park or Cage; his Concubines in the mean time Singing about him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vows for his ſucceſs, his ſhort Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies he performs on Horſe-Back and the longer on Elephants covered over with Gold, and a long Train of Concubines follow him in Golden Couches or Chairs. And equal to this is the Luxury of the Queen and her Attendants, ſo that we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conclude that <hi>Alexander</hi> found no
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:110363:91"/> great difficulty in ſubduing ſuch Debaucht and Effeminate Nations, who were full Ripe for Divine Vengeance.</p>
            <p>We come now to the winding up of the Story of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who did ſo far degenerate into the Manners and Vices of thoſe People he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, that he gave Crowns to ſome and took away Lives from others at the will and pleaſure of his Whores, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of <hi>Bagoas</hi> the Eunuch, who was his Catamite. <hi>Curtius</hi> gives us an Inſtance of this in his 10th. Book, where he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates how <hi>Orſines</hi> a Great <hi>Perſian</hi> Prince of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s off-ſpring, was falſely Accuſed and Executed, becauſe he deſpis'd that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous Eunuch, and ſaid that it was not Whores and Catamites that he had any regard for, but only to the King's Friends, and when this Revengefull Catamite had got <hi>Alexander</hi> to Condemn this great Man, who had at all times been very Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Bountifull to the King and his Retinue, he could not forbear to aſſiſt at the Execution himſelf, upon which <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines</hi> told him Satyrically, <hi>That he had heard that Women had ſometimes Govern'd</hi> Aſia, <hi>but it was never Govern'd by a Guelding before.</hi> Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> being Govern'd by thoſe Vile Perſons, did upon their Accuſation cut off his beſt Friends, and became ſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his own <hi>Greeks,</hi> that they talk'd divers times of Revolting, and at laſt Poyſon'd him in <hi>Babylon</hi> amidſt his Feaſts and Revels, which was very Remarkable
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:110363:91"/> that he ſhould be Poyſon'd there where he had ſuffered himſelf and his Army to be firſt Poyſoned by the Vicious Manners of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and thus by his Luxury and Uncleanneſs he occaſioned the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that vaſt Empire, which he had rais'd; his Great Captains after his Death having each of them erected Monarchies for themſelves in thoſe Places where they Govern'd, which occaſioned the ſpeedier diſſolution of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, and that it was leſs taken notice of as not being cemented together under one head. ſo true is it which the Wiſeman tells us in the <hi>Proverbs, That many ſtrong men have been ſlain and caſt down by ſtrange Women;</hi> nay, we may add that Empires and Monarchies have been over-turned by Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>The next remarkable inſtance we meet with in <hi>Juſtin</hi> is that of <hi>Dionyſius, junior</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who was as infamous for Uncleanneſs as for Cruelty, and being expelled by the Inhabitants of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> he was received by thoſe of <hi>Locris,</hi> where having ſurprizd the Caſtle he Tyranniz'd alſo over them, Raviſh'd the Wives of the Great Men, and the young Women before Marriage, and would then ſend them back to their Sweet-hearts. The <hi>Locrenſes</hi> being at that time in War with <hi>Leophron,</hi> they vow'd if they came off Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers to proſtitute their Virgins on the Feſtival of <hi>Venus,</hi> which having neglected to do, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Circumvented the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens thus, he adviſed them in order to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:110363:92"/> perform their Vow, to ſend all their Women with their Richeſt Apparel to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Venus,</hi> and chuſe out a hundred of their handſomeſt Virgins and ſend them Richly adorn'd to ſtay a Month in a Brothell-Houſe, but beforehand to oblige all their Men by Oath not to touch one of them, and likewiſe to take an Oath that none ſhould be Married 'till all thoſe Virgins were firſt diſpos'd in Marriage. The Citizens thinking this a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance both to abſolve themſelves from their Oaths and to preſerve the Chaſtity of their Virgins, did accordingly. Where. upon <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſent his Soldiers who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled the Women both of their Honour and Ornaments, which ſo incens'd the <hi>Locrenſes</hi> againſt him that they likewiſe drove him out of their City, and being received again by the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> he Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over them in his uſual Manner, ſo that they Beſieged him and forcing him to lay down the Government, he liv'd in Exile at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he ſpent his time in Taverns and Bawdy-Houſes, went in a fordid Habit, kept the Meaneſt and moſt Raſcally Company. Jangl'd with Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels and Bawds, became a laughing ſtock to every Body, and would walk about in the Shambles to gaze upon the Meat that he was not able to buy, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſo low that partly to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and partly to ſatisfy his Tyrannical humour, he taught a Trivial School, and ſo concluded his Life as Ingloriouſly as he led it.</p>
            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:110363:92"/>

The Subjects were ſo much enraged with theſe proceedings, that they threw down his Statues and Pictures every where, which he conceiving to be done by his Siſter's advice, he cut the Son that he had by her in pieces, put them up in a Box, and ſent them to his Mother, on his Birth-day—Thus were they mutually plagued and puniſhed for their Inceſt, and a deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

They alſo he knew had Daughters and Wives, nor was the Luſt of</hi> Appius Claudius <hi>extinguiſhed by his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Death; but that the more he eſcaped pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, the more extravagant, he would be. That by another Man's Calamity, they were taught to provide againſt the like injury.

            <p>In the 28<hi>th</hi> Chapter of that ſame Book, he gives us a Relation of the Ignominy and ſhame that <hi>L. Papirius</hi> an Uſurer brought upon himſelf by his unnatural Luſt, and of the benefit which accrewed to the people by a Villanous Outrage that he committed upon the Body of <hi>C. Publius,</hi> a Comely Youth, the occaſion of which was thus. There was a barbarous Cuſtom then in uſe amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> called <hi>Nexus,</hi> being a kind of obligation whereby perſons that ow'd Money were bound to their Creditors, to be their Slaves, and to work wholly for them till their Debts were paid. By vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which Cuſtom <hi>C. Publius</hi> was forc'd to bind himſelf for a Debt of his Father's to <hi>Papirius:</hi> Who being a luſtful Wretch, endeavoured firſt to debanch the Youth by filthy Speeches and flatteries, but ſinding him proof againſt thoſe tentations, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to terrifie him with threats, and ever and anon put him in mind of his Fortune, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was a Slave; but the Honeſt Youth not being to be prevailed upon this way neither, the Savage Uſurer converting his Luſt into Rage, caus'd the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:110363:100" rendition="simple:additions"/> poor youth to be ſtrip'd naked and cruelly whip'd, by which his body was deſperately torn and mangled, the oppreſſed youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to endure that Diſgrace and Torment, ran out into the Street in that condition, and cried out upon the Uſurer for his Cruelty and Luſt. This occaſioned a Great Concourſe of people, who being mov'd with Compaſſion towards the young-man, and with abhorrence at the Indignity of the thing, as that which might perhaps befall themſelves or their Children, they crowded into the Forum, and from thence went in a full Body to the Council Chamber, which obliged the Conſuls to call a Senate; and as the Fathers entred the Houſe, the people falling at their feet ſhewed them the young man's mangled and Bloody Back, whereupon a Law was paſſed that from thence forward the Eſtate and Goods and not the Body of any Debtor ſhould be Chargeable for Debts. Thus was <hi>Papirius</hi> juſtly puniſhed, for his Luſt and Savage Cruelty, in loſing his Money, being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Object of his Luſt, and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with perpetual Infamy.</p>
            <p>That ſame Author, <hi>Decad</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap</hi> 57. tells us that <hi>Opimia</hi> and <hi>Floronia</hi> two Veſtal Nuns being convicted of Whoredom were buried alive, and <hi>Lucius Cantilius</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the Pontiſſs, that committed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt with <hi>Floronia</hi> was whipt to death by the Arch-Pontiſſ in the Common-hall.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:110363:100"/> they ſent to the Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> to enquire how it might be expiated and had this Anſwer returned, that they muſt bury two Couples alive in the Beaſt Market, <hi>viz.</hi> a French-man and a French-woman and a Greekman and a Greekwoman, which was accordingly performed.</p>
            <p>In the third Book of that <hi>Decad,</hi> we have an account that <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army which had not long before obtained a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Victory over the <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Cannae,</hi> became ſo debaucht by wintering in <hi>Capua</hi> a Laſcivious City, that they ſpent their time in Sleep, Drunkenneſs, delicate Fare, Stews, Hot-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſo weakned their Bodies and debauched their Minds, that his wintering at <hi>Capua</hi> was reckoned no leſs an overſight in <hi>Hannibal,</hi> than was his not marching ſtraight way to <hi>Rome</hi> upon a defeat which he gave the <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Cannae,</hi> for when he marched out of <hi>Capua</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was entangled with Harlots, and his Men were rendred ſo effeminate with their Luxury, that they could not endure fatigues as formerly, but fled from their Colours in great numbers, and from that very time the decay of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Glory and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and the fall of their Government may take its date, ſuch have always been the fatal conſequences of Luxury or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs to people and Nations.</p>

            <p>Our next Inſtance is, that of <hi>Sophoniſba, Decad</hi> 3. <hi>Book</hi> 10 <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. She was daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> the Famous <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General, and Married to <hi>Syphax</hi> King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who being routed by <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> King of <hi>Maſſilia,</hi> and an Allie of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> whom he had diſpoiled of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> was ſo enchanted with Love
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:110363:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> to <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> that he married her within a few hours of his having taken her Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſuch was his impetuous Luſt and her accurſed Inconſtancy, for when he came into the Pallace where ſhe was, her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs to him ſavoured more of a Courteſan than either of a Conſtant Wife or a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Queen, ſo that ſhe ſeem'd rather to Court him than avoid his Embraces, for which Divine Juſtice ſoon found her out. Her Husband <hi>Syphax</hi> being taken and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before <hi>Scipio,</hi> who asked him, why he made War upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> anſwered, That his Palace was ſet on fire by Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptial Torches, when he married <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> who never reſted till ſhe had armed his Hands againſt himſelf, as well as his Gueſt and good Friend: yet, That amidſt all his Miſeries he had this Comfort ſtill, that he ſaw the ſame Peſt and Fury was got into the Houſe and Family of his greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> was not more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or conſtant than <hi>Syphax.</hi> This obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Scipio</hi> to rebuke and expoſtulate with <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> privately, thus: Maſſiniſſa, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that you ſaw ſome good things in me, not only when you came firſt into</hi> Spain <hi>to contract Friendſhip with me, but afterwards alſo, when I came into</hi> Africa, <hi>you committed both your ſelf and all your Hopes to my protection: But there is no Virtue, for which I ſeem to be a fit Object of your Affections, wherein I glory ſo much as in the government and maſtery I have over my Luſts; and this I would have you alſo,</hi> Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa, <hi>add to your other extraordinary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:110363:102"/> for there is not, believe me, ſo much Danger to be fear'd, in our Age, from armed Foes, as from Pleaſures that ſurrounds us on every ſide.</hi> After a great deal more to this purpoſe, he concluded thus; <hi>Subdue your paſſion, and have a care you do not deform many Virtues with one Vice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> was ſo much ſtruck with this Mercurial Speech, that after a ſharp Conflict with his Paſſion and impetuous Amour, he ſent a truſty Servant with a Cup of Poyſon to <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> and to tell her, That <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have perform'd his firſt Promiſe to her, as an Husband ought to his Wife, but ſince they that were able to do it had taken that Power out of his Hands, he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make good his ſecond Promiſe, That ſhe ſhould not be, whilſt alive, in the Hands of any <hi>Roman,</hi> as being mindful of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was a General, her Country, and the two Kings to whom ſhe had been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and that ſhe therefore ſhould conſult her own Good. To which <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> with a Conſtancy much more commendable than ſhe was endow'd with when <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted her with his Amours, anſwer'd, <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Nuptial Preſent; nor is it unwelcome to me, if my Husband could do no more for me; yet tell him this from me, That I ſhould have dy'd much better, if I had not been married at my Funeral:</hi> And ſo drank it off, without any more ado. Thus was ſhe puniſh'd for her Diſloyalty to her Husband <hi>Syphax;</hi> for it had been an eaſie matter for a Woman of ſuch vaſt Courage as ſhe appears to have
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:110363:102"/> been, to have deliver'd her ſelf by Death from <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi>'s Embraces, as well before as after ſhe had polluted her ſelf with ſuch an Unlawful Marriage.</p>
            <p>The next thing ſuitable to our Subject, which occurs to us in this Hiſtorian, is the Controverſie which happen'd among the <hi>Romans,</hi> about abrogating the <hi>Oppian</hi> Law for reſtraining the Luxury of Women's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel. <hi>Marcus Portius Cato</hi> was for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the <hi>Law,</hi> and in his grave Oration on that Head had theſe remarkable Sayings concerning it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>if every one of the</hi> Romans <hi>had reſolv'd to maintain the majeſty and prerogative of an Husband over his own Wife, we ſhould not have had all this Trouble with the Women in general; but now our</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>being reſtrain'd at home, by the Tyranny of our own Women, 'tis intrench'd and trampl'd upon here in the</hi> Forum.—Our Anceſtors would not ſuffer Women to do any private Buſineſs, without the Advice of a Man, but to be at the diſpoſal of their Parents, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or Husband; but We, forſooth, now-adays, let them manage even the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> it ſelf. You have often heard me complain not only of the Prodigality of Women, but of Men too, and thoſe as well Magiſtrates as private Perſons; and, that the City labours under <hi>two</hi> different Vices of <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> which have been the Bane of all great Empires.—<hi>But,</hi> ſays a great Lady, <hi>I cannot endure this levelling and equality; why ſhould not I appear all glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with Gold, and cloathed in Purple? Why
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:110363:103"/> ſhould the</hi> Poverty <hi>of others lie hid under the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrage of this Law, ſo as what they cannot have, they, if it were lawful, ſhould ſeem able to buy? Will you</hi> Romans <hi>give your Wives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to contend in this manner, that the Rich Women ſhall deſire to have what no Woman elſe can purchaſe, and the poorer ſort, leſt for this very Reaſon they ſhould be contemn'd, to ſtretch beyond their Abilities? She that can, out of her own Stock, will purchaſe the thing ſhe lacks; and ſhe that cannot, will ask her Husband; and woe be to that man who either does or does not grant their Requeſts, when he shall ſee that which he himſelf would not give her, given her by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man.</hi> And abundance more to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which is the Opinion that the Wiſeſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> had of Temperance, and the Abhorrence they had of Luxury, as being always the Forerunner of the Ruine of any State or People.</p>
            <p>In the 8th <hi>Book, cap.</hi> 24, <hi>Decade</hi> 11, he gives us an Account of a memorable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a <hi>Roman</hi> Centurion, for violating the Chaſtity of a petty <hi>Grecian</hi> Queen, who was committed to his Cuſtody among other Captives. The Centurion being taken with her Beauty, did firſt ſound her Inclinations, but finding her averſe to Voluntary Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, he offer'd Violence to her Body, which Fortune had made a Slave; after which, he put her in Hopes of returning into her own Country, but at the ſame time bargain'd with her for ſo much Gold; and leſt any of his own People ſhould know it, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her to ſend one of the other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:110363:103"/> whom ſhe pleas'd, to bring the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and two of her Friends, to receive her at the ſide of a River, whither he went the next Night, with his Captive, to meet them. As ſoon as they had ſhew'd him the Gold, the Lady commanded her Friends to draw their Swords, and kill the Centurion; which being done, ſhe order'd them to cut off his Head, and wrapping it up in her Gown, carried it to her Husband <hi>Ortiagon,</hi> whom before ſhe embraced, ſhe threw the Centurion's Head at his Feet, acquainting him what Injury ſhe had receiv'd, and how ſhe had reveng'd it; and ſpent the remaining part of her Life without any Stain upon her Conjugal Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>The next thing belonging to our Subject which occurrs in this Hiſtorian, is, his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Rites, <hi>Decad.</hi> 4, <hi>Lib.</hi> 9, <hi>Cap.</hi> 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There came a petty Prieſt, or Prophet, of thoſe Times, out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Etruria,</hi> now <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who was the chief Manager of certain Rites call'd <hi>Initia,</hi> to which Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Performance there were added the Pleaſures of Feaſting and Wine, and when Wine and the Night, the Men and Women being mixt together, had extinguiſh'd all Senſe of Shame, firſt there were Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all ſorts committed, ingenuous Men and Women lay promiſcuouſly with one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another, and falſe Witneſſes, falſe Tokens and Judgments, came out of that ſame Office of Roguery; and many times People were kill'd or poyſon'd in their own Houſes, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:110363:104"/> frequently 'twas ſo order'd, that their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies could not be found to be buried. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Crimes were carried on by Treachery, and more by Force, and thoſe Outrages were conceal'd, by reaſon of their Houlings and the noiſe of their Drums and Cymbals, ſo that no-body could hear the Cries of thoſe that had Violence offer'd to them when they were kill'd, or had Violence offer'd to their Chaſtity. This Miſchief came from <hi>Etruria</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the bigneſs of the City con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd their Villanies.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Wicked Practices came at length to be diſcover'd by <hi>Poſtumius</hi> the Conſul, in the following manner. <hi>P. Aebutius</hi> being left an Orphan, was educated under the tutelage of his Mother <hi>Duronia,</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law <hi>T. Sempronius Rutilus,</hi> of whom his Mother was mighty fond. His Father-in-law having manag'd the Guardianſhip at that rate, that he could give no good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, had a mind either to deſtroy the Young-man, or to have him oblig'd to him by ſome Bond; and the beſt Way he could contrive to effect his Deſign was, by the <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Rites:—Whereupon <hi>Duronia</hi> call'd her Son, and told him, that <hi>ſhe had vow'd when he was ſick, that as ſoon as he recover'd ſhe would initiate him in the</hi> Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanalia, <hi>which ſhe was now reſolv'd to perform;</hi> telling him, <hi>that he muſt live Chaſte for ten days; that on the tenth day ſhe would carry him to Supper, and afterwards, when he was clean waſh'd, into the</hi> Sacrary. <hi>Aebutius</hi> happening to impart this to <hi>Hiſpala Fecenia,</hi> a Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:110363:104"/> with whom he kept company, and who lov'd him entirely, ſhe diſſuaded him from it, telling him, <hi>it was a ſnare laid for his Life,</hi> and pray'd, that <hi>a thouſand Curſes might light on their Heads who perſwaded him to it.</hi> The Youth admiring at the Diſorder ſhe was in, deſir'd her to ſpare her Curſes, for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the Conſent of his Father in-law, had commanded him ſo to do; to which she replied, <hi>Your Father in-law makes haſte to deſtroy your Credit, Hopes, and Life.—</hi>This put him into a Surprize, and made him the more eager to know what the matter was; whereupon ſhe (begging Pardon of the Gods and Goddeſſes, if, forced by the Love she bore him, she reveal'd things that ought to have been conceal'd) told him, that when she was a Waiting-maid, she went along with her Miſtreſs into that Sacrary, but ſince she was free, never came within it: That she knew it to be the Shop of all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; that as ſoon as any Perſon was introduc'd, he was deliver'd, like a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to the Prieſts, who carried him into a place that rung round with Howlings, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Cymbals, and Drums, that the Voice of any one that complain'd, when Luſtful Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was offer'd to them, might not be heard: Wherefore she deſir'd and beſeech'd him, that he would diſengage himſelf from that Deſign, by any means whatſoever, and not throw himſelf headlong into that place, where he muſt both do and ſuffer all the moſt abominable things imaginable. Nor would she let him ſtir from her, before the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:110363:105"/> Young-man had promis'd that he would keep away from thoſe Myſteries.</p>
            <p>When he came home, his Mother began to tell him what he muſt do in order to his initiation; to which he anſwer'd, That <hi>he would not be initiated at all:</hi> Whereupon she cried out, That <hi>he was ſo intoxicated with that Serpent</hi> Hiſpala, <hi>that he had loſt all reſpect for his Father-in-law, his Mother, and the Gods themſelves.</hi> His Father-in-law laying hold of the Opportunity, turn'd him out of doors, with four Servants; whereupon the Young-man went to his Aunt <hi>Aebutia,</hi> a grave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and acquainted her with the Cauſe of his being turn'd out; ſhe advis'd him to make Complaint to the Conſul <hi>Poſtumius</hi> the next day, which he did privately; the Conſul did thereupon ſend for <hi>Aebutia,</hi> and being inform'd by her concerning her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Abutius,</hi> he ſent likewiſe for <hi>Hiſpala,</hi> who being amaz'd that ſhe ſhould be ſent for by a perſon of that Dignity, went to his Houſe full of Fear.—The Conſul taking her aſide, examin'd her before his Mother-in-law <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> a noble and grave Lady, concerning what was done in the Grove of <hi>Simele,</hi> at the <hi>Bacchanals:</hi> She was ſo much ſurpriz'd, that for ſome time ſhe ſtood ſpeechleſs, and at laſt confeſs'd, That <hi>when ſhe was a very little Girl, and a Servant, ſhe was initiated with her Miſtreſs, but, for ſome Years, ſhe knew nothing of what they did there,</hi> and would fain have evaded any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtions, <hi>being afraid of the Gods</hi> (she ſaid) <hi>whoſe Secrets ſhe had diſcover'd, but of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:110363:105"/> Men much more, who would tear her in pieces for being ſuch an Informer;</hi> and therefore pray'd they would ſend her to ſome place out of <hi>Italy,</hi> where she might be in Safety. The Conſul promis'd, that <hi>ſhe ſhould</hi> live ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure at <hi>Rome;</hi> and then she declar'd, that there was no manner of Villany omitted at thoſe Rites; that there were more Luſtful Enormities committed by the Men, among themſelves, than by the Women; that if any one were unwilling to endure ſuch Shameleſs Actions, and ſlow to Wickedneſs, they were ſacrific'd for Victims, for they thought nothing unlawful, which was the greateſt Tenet of their Religion, that ſuch Men as would not conſpire, aſſociate in Villany, or endure their Luſtful Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they carried away into ſecret Dens and Caves, and gave out, that they were ſnatch'd away by the Gods; and that for two Years paſt they had order'd, that no body should be initiated, who was above <hi>Twenty Years</hi> of age, becauſe the younger they were, they thought they would be the more ready to endure their Folly and Leud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Conſul being thus throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the matter, acquainted the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with it, and amongſt other things, in his Speech to them, had theſe remarkable Sayings: <hi>Do you think,</hi> Romans, <hi>that Young-men, who are initiated into this Order, are fit to be made Souldiers of? Shall we put them in Arms, that come out of ſuch an obſcene Brothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe? Will ſuch Fellows as theſe, that are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd all over with Buggeries of their own and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:110363:106"/> other men, fight for the Chaſtity of their Wives and Children?</hi> And ſetting forth at large the Danger that might accrue to the State by thoſe Nightly Meetings, the <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Rites were prohibited by Order of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, all the Prieſts of the Order were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be shut up, and the Frequenters of thoſe Nightly Meetings enquir'd after; ſuch of them as they found to have been only initiated, and had ſaid Prayers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Sacred Form, which the Prieſts repeated before them, in which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a curſed Obligation to commit all Acts of Villany and Lechery, but had not committed them, them they impriſon'd; but thoſe whom they found to have been defil'd by Luſt or Murder, falſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, falſe Tokens, forging of Wills, or other Frauds, they put to Death; after which the <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> were pull'd down at <hi>Rome,</hi> and all over <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall conclude our Inſtances from <hi>Livy,</hi> with this Paſſage, which is the laſt that fam'd Hiſtorian affords us, that any way relates to our Subject.—It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per however to obſerve here, that the <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanalia,</hi> which we have now deſcrib'd, may juſtly be reckon'd a-Kin to, if not the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of, the <hi>Eleuſina Sacra</hi> formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; both of them had their Original from <hi>Greece,</hi> and were ſolemniz'd with much the like Secrecy and Outrage; and both of them ſerve to let us ſee how far Humane Nature may be deprav'd by raging Luſt,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:110363:106"/> when a Perſon or People are juſtly given up to it of God.</p>
            <p>We think it proper, before we come to the Inſtances of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are but too too numerous, to take a view of thoſe perſons whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> has honour'd to be their Biographer, and to excerpt from thence what ſuits with our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>We have taken notice, that <hi>Rome</hi> was founded by a ſpurious Brood, and in the Life of <hi>Theſcus,</hi> which is the firſt in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch:</hi> We shall find that <hi>Athens</hi> had much the ſame ſort of Original; which is the more obſervable, becauſe from thoſe two Cities the Chriſtian Religion met with the greateſt Oppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> from the vain <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of the former, and the more bloody and cruel <hi>Perſecution</hi> of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Our Author tells us, That <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſeems to reſemble <hi>Romulus</hi> in many particulars, and in his Birth eſpecially, both of'em be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born out of Wedlock, and of uncertain Parentage. <hi>Ageus</hi> however is reckon'd to be Father to <hi>Theſeus,</hi> by <hi>Athia</hi> Daughter to <hi>Plitheus,</hi> whom having got with Child, he left a Sword and a pair of Shoes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hiding them under a great Stone, and making her only privy to it, commanding her, that if ſhe brought forth a Son, who when he came to Man's eſtate should be able to lift up the Stone, and take away what he had left there, she should ſend him away to him with thoſe things with all Secrecy: Which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:110363:107"/> she having accordingly obſerv'd, her Son <hi>Theſeus,</hi> after he had ſlain <hi>Sinnis,</hi> who from his way of murthering Men was call'd <hi>The Bender of Pines,</hi> committed Fornication with his Daughter <hi>Perigune,</hi> begot <hi>Menalippus</hi> upon her, and afterwards married her to another. The next Feat <hi>Theſeus</hi> did, was the killing of <hi>Phea,</hi> a Beaſt of great fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according to ſome, or a cruel and luſtful Woman, according to others, who had the Name of <hi>a Sow</hi> given her, from the beaſtlineſs of her Life; which, if true, she was remarkably enough punish'd, by one that was as guilty of Incontinence as her ſelf.—The next thing we have of his Amours is, that with <hi>Ariadne,</hi> by whoſe Advice and Aſſiſtance he overcame the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notaur;</hi> but having ſerv'd his Ends, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted her for another, <hi>viz. Aegle,</hi> with whom he fell in Love, and thereupon <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adue</hi> died of Grief, as ſome ſay, tho' others contradict it, and alledge, She died in Childbed.—Our Author gives us alſo an Account of his Rape of <hi>Antiope,</hi> Princeſs of the <hi>Amazons,</hi>—and, in short, ſums up his unlawful Amours, and the fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of them, in a few words, thus: That the Marriages of <hi>Theſeus</hi> were neither ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in their beginning, nor fortunate in their Events;—and recounts them thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that he forc'd <hi>Anaxo</hi> the <hi>Traxenian;</hi> ravish'd the Daughters of <hi>Sinnis</hi> and <hi>Cercyon;</hi> married <hi>Peribaea</hi> the Mother of <hi>Ajax,</hi> and then <hi>Pheribaea,</hi> and then <hi>Iope</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Iphicles:</hi> Further he is accus'd for deſerting
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:110363:107"/> 
               <hi>Ariadne,</hi> as is before related, being in love with <hi>Aegle,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Panopeus,</hi> an Action neither juſt nor honourable; and laſtly, for the Rape of <hi>Helen,</hi> when he was fifty Years old, which fill'd all <hi>Attica</hi> with <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and occaſion'd his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and Death, <hi>Lycomedes</hi> having thrown him headlong from a Rock, as he had hurried himſelf headlong into Luſtful Paſſion. Such was the fatal Exit of this <hi>Ethnick</hi> Hero, occaſion'd by his Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>In the Life of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that great <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> Philoſopher and Law-giver, we have an eminent Inſtance of the truth of that of the Apoſtle concerning the Heathens, that becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, he gave them up to work all Uncleanneſs with greedineſs; for what leſs than a Judicial Blindneſs could ſo much infatuate ſuch a wiſe man as <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Community of Wives, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Dancings of young Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men together naked, that muſt neceſſarily inflame their Luſts? Which is own'd by <hi>Plutarch</hi> himſelf, tho' cover'd under the handſom Expreſſions of <hi>alluring them to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, not upon Intereſt and Equality of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Birth, but from the ſweet Conſtraint and unſophiſticated Dictates of Nature.</hi>—The Reaſons of this <hi>Community of Women</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd by theſe Arguments following, <hi>viz. That Children are not ſo much the Propriety of their Parents, as of the Commonwealth, and therefore he would not have 'em begot by the firſt Comers, but by the beſt Men that could be found:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:110363:108"/> That the</hi> Laws <hi>of other Nations ſeem'd to him very defective and incongruous, who were very ſollicitous for the Bread of their Dogs and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſent a great way to get the beſt Stallions, and yet kept their Wives under Lock and Key, for fear of other Men; whereas themſelves were craz'd, old, or infirm, and more fit to propagate Diſeaſes than their Species.</hi> Certainly any man, at firſt ſight, muſt needs ſee that thoſe Dictates of our Philoſopher are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Dictates of Nature, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Introductive of all manner of Villany and Diſorders.—Reaſon, as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, teaches us, that Jealouſie is the Rage of a Man, and that there is nothing more unſupportable to Humane Nature. All Hiſtories are full of Tragical Inſtances of it; and Experience teaches us, that thoſe Nations where ſuch promiſcuous Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are allow'd, differ but very little from Brutes, whoſe Example <hi>Lycurgus</hi> propoſes, and they follow. If it be objected, What we find in the Life of our Author, that ſo long as theſe Ordinances were obſerv'd, the Women were ſo far from that Scandalous Liberty which hath ſince been objected to them, that they knew not what the Name of Adultery meant; it may be anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, That it implies a downright Contradiction; for if thoſe Ordinances were obſerv'd, the Commonwealth of <hi>Sparta</hi> muſt neceſſarily have abounded with Adultery, whether they knew the Name of it or not: But it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that ſeeing ſuch a Choice of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> was allow'd them by <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Laws,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:110363:108"/> they did not reckon lying with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Wives Adultery: And therefore <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radas</hi> might well ſay, That <hi>it was as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find an Adulterer in</hi> Sparta, <hi>as to find a Bull with a Neck ſo long, that he could ſtand at one ſide of the Mountain</hi> Taygetus, <hi>and drink of the River that run on the other ſide of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo obſervable, that this Practiſe did not anſwer the End taken from his Brutiſh Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> to have ſtrong and healthful Children; for we have an Account by this ſame Author, that if they found the Child upon its Birth to be deform'd, and of an ill Complexion, they order'd it to be caſt into a deep Cavern of the Earth, near the Mountain <hi>Taygetus;</hi> and that the Women did alſo bath the new-born Children in Wine, thinking it would immediately kill thoſe of a weak Conſtitution: And yet, notwithſtanding all thoſe Precautions, we find that they had weakly Children bred up, and thoſe, our Author ſays, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in gathering Sallads and Herbs.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point; It is not at all to be wonder'd at, that a People who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd ſuch Unfaithfulneſs as to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-bed, ſhould grow ſo unfaithful in all their other Tranſactions as the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> did, which occaſion'd their being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruin'd by the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Life of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> ſo much reverenc'd by the <hi>Romans</hi> for his Piety, and accounted the firſt Inſtituter of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we find, that when a <hi>Roman</hi> was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtock'd with Children, in caſe his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:110363:109"/> Neighbour, who had none, ſhould deſire him to accommodate him with his Wife; that he alſo might have the Benefit of Iſſue from ſuch a fruitful Woman: <hi>Numa</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Husband either to lend his Wife for a time, or to looſe the Bonds of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and conſign her into the Hands of her Paramour for ever.—An early Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that <hi>Rome</hi> was at laſt to become the <hi>Mother of Harlots, and of the Abominations of the Earth;</hi> another Inſtance of thoſe wiſe Heathens being judicially given up of God to their Uncleanneſs, becauſe they did not improve the Knowledge they had to the Glory of God, of whoſe Being and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes they had ſuch clear Ideas.</p>
            <p>In the Life of <hi>Solon</hi> we have an Account That that great <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and <hi>Law-giver</hi> was guilty of Unlawful Love towards Boys, and that deſigning to appropriate that Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh pleaſure to ſuch as he call'd Gentlemen, he forbad the uſe of it to Slaves. In one of his Laws he permits an Heireſs, if her Lawful Husband prove impotent, to lye with his neareſt Kinſman; and yet he was ſo inconſiſtent with himſelf, that he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any one to kill an Adulterer, that found him in the Act.—We shall conclude this paſſage with his Account of himſelf in this Diſtick:</p>

            <p>In the Life of <hi>Lucullus</hi> we find, that there was a ſtop put to the Careir of his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Glory, chiefly by means of <hi>Clodius,</hi> his Wife's Brother, who was ſo unnatural a Villain as to commit Adultery and Inceſt with his own Siſter <hi>Clodia, Lucullus</hi>'s Wife, and ſtirring up the <hi>Fimbrian</hi> Army againſt <hi>Lucullus,</hi> prevented his further Conqueſts: <hi>Lucullus</hi> himſelf returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> gave himſelf up to all manner of Luxury, and was at laſt depriv'd of his Senſes by a Philtre or Amorous Potion, giv'n him by <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> his Freeman, to endear him to himſelf; ſo that this Great Man was not only ruin'd by the Laſciviouſneſs of himſelf and others, but a ſtop was thereby put to the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſts, which had otherwiſe, ſays our Author, not been bounded by the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> but by the uttermoſt parts of the Earth, and the <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>In the Life of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great we find that famous General accus'd of unchaſte A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours with <hi>Flora</hi> the Courteſan, whom he afterwards reſign'd to his Friend <hi>Geminius,</hi> upon which ſhe languiſh'd and died. We find likewiſe, that <hi>Sylla,</hi> to gain over this Great Man to his Party, perſwaded him to put away his Wife <hi>Antiſtia,</hi> and to marry <hi>Aemilia</hi> Daughter-in-law to <hi>Sylla,</hi> who was at that time Wife to another Man, by whom ſhe was big with Child. This unlawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was ſoon after puniſh'd in part, for <hi>Antiſtius,</hi> Father to <hi>Antiſtia,</hi> was murder'd in
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:110363:115"/> the Senate, as a Favourer of <hi>Sylla</hi> for <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s ſake, and her Mother upon this account made away with her ſelf.—Theſe were the Tragedies that attended that unhappy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſays <hi>Plutarch;</hi> and that there might be nothing wanting to compleat the laſt Act by Heav'ns, even <hi>Aemilia</hi> her ſelf not long after died at <hi>Pompey</hi>'s in Child-bed.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were the more inexcuſable in <hi>Pompey,</hi> becauſe we find that he delighted much in the diſcovery of Weakneſſes of the ſame Nature in <hi>Mithridates,</hi> when he ſeiz'd his ſecret Writings, wherein, amongſt other things, he found abundance of wanton Love-Letters betwixt <hi>Mithridates</hi> and his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine <hi>Monune.</hi>—He might have taken War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, one would think, of the Judgments that purſued <hi>Mithridates</hi> for his Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſeeing when all his Concubines were brought before <hi>Pompey,</hi> he could not but perceive the abominable Crimes into which his luſtful Temper had hurried him head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, for moſt of his Concubines were either the Daughters or Wives of Princes and great Commanders, except it was one whom they call'd <hi>Stratonice,</hi> who was Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Muſician; and having pleas'd <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> by ſinging before him at a Banquet, his luſtful Paſſion was ſo much rais'd that he immediately took her to Bed with him, and in the Morning preſented her Father (who grumbl'd that he had taken his Daughter without ſpeaking one kind Word to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) with many rich and coſtly Preſents, and the Eſtate of a Nobleman lately deceas'd,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:110363:115"/> whereupon the old Fellow was ſo much tranſported, that putting on his Purple Robes, and mounting his Horſe, he rode through the City, crying out, <hi>All this is mine,</hi> and ſo became the Herauld of his own, as well as of <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Folly; and to thoſe that laugh'd at him for the ſame he ſaid, <hi>There was no ſuch Wonder in this, but rather, that he did not throw Stones at all he met, he was ſo much beſide himſelf with Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Piece of Vengeance that purſued <hi>Pompey,</hi> and wherein he might read his Crime in his Puniſhment, was, That his Wife <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> during his abſence, had diſhonour'd his Bed; at which he was ſo nettl'd, that he ſent her a Bill of Divorce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey,</hi> in purſuit of his Amorous Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, did likewiſe commit a piece of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Injuſtice, in marrying <hi>Julia,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who had been affianced before, and was to be married within a few days to <hi>Caepio,</hi> and, to appeaſe <hi>Caepio</hi>'s Anger, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his own Daughter to him, who had formerly been eſpouſed to <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sylla. Pompey</hi> was ſo much beſotted with his Love to <hi>Julia,</hi> that he created abundance of Envy to himſelf, by committing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Provinces and Legions into the Hands of his Friends, as his Lieutenants, whilſt he himſelf wantonly rambl'd up and down, careſſing his Wife, throughout all the Delicacies of <hi>Italy;</hi> but he was ſoon depriv'd of her, for ſhe dy'd in Child-bed, her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not outliving her many days.</p>
            <pb n="206" facs="tcp:110363:116"/>
            <p> He afterwards married <hi>Cornelia</hi> Daughter to <hi>Metellius Scipio,</hi> and Relict of <hi>Publius</hi> the Son of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> a young Lady of great Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Beauty, and Education; but this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was very unpleaſing to ſome People, who thought that ſhe was a Match more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Son, and were angry that the Affairs of the City lay neglected, while he, from whom they expected a Cure to their Diſtractions, went crown'd with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and was revelling in his Nuptial Feaſts.</p>
            <p>It's obſervable, that at the very laſt his Fondneſs towards this young Lady, and his Fear that her Beauty might expoſe her to ſome Diſhonour amongſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> was the chief Argument that prevail'd with him not to have recourſe thither, where, in all probability, he might have been able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the War, and recover his Glory, after his Defeat in the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> Plains; ſo that reſolving to ſail for <hi>Egypt,</hi> and intruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> he was, by Advice of that young King's Council, barbarouſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly murder'd, as going aſhore in a Boat in order, as he thought, to a favourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; the diſtreſſed <hi>Cornelia</hi> and his Friends beholding this lamentable Tragedy from on board the Veſſels where they were. Thus fell this Great Man, to which, it cannot be denied, that his Amorous and Senſual Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per did highly contribute: Not that I would be underſtood poſitively to aſſert, that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs was the ſole procuring Cauſe of thoſe Tragical Diſaſters that befel the great
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:110363:116"/> Man and others, whom I have mention'd or ſhall mention in the courſe of this Hiſtory, it being enough for my Deſign to prove, that it was always one of the viſible Cauſes, and that it makes good the Aſſertion of the Wiſe Man in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> where ſpeaking of the Harlot or ſtrange Woman in general, he ſays, That <hi>many ſtrong Men have been ſlain by her;</hi> of which there is not a more ſpeaking and demonſtrable Inſtance than this of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> who had triumph'd over <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and yet was himſelf a Captive and Subject of Triumph to his own Luſts.</p>
            <p>In the Life of <hi>Cato</hi> the younger, who was not only a great Pretender to Virtue, but, compar'd with his Contemporaries, a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mirror of it. We find that he had no true Notions of the Honour of the Marriage Bed, nor any juſt Idea of Chaſtity; as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from the following Inſtance. <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Hortenſius,</hi> whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls <hi>a Man of ſingular Worth and approved Virtue,</hi> propos'd to <hi>Cato,</hi> That his Daughter <hi>Porcia,</hi> who was already married to <hi>Bibulus,</hi> and had already born him two Children, might be given to him as a fruitful Field, from which he might raiſe an Offspring; <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>tho' this in the Opinion of Men may ſeem ſtrange, yet in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it would be honeſt and profitable for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that a Woman, in the prime of her Youth, ſhould not lye uſeleſs, and loſe the Fruit of her Womb: Nor, on the other ſide, would it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſhe ſhould burthen and impoveriſh one Man, by bringing him too many Children.

               <hi>Men, Virtue would encreaſe and be diffus'd thro' their Poſterity, and the Commonwealth would be united and cemented by their Alliances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet, if</hi> Bibulus <hi>would not part with his Wife altogether, he would reſtore her as ſoon as ſhe had brought him a Child, whereby he might be united to both their Families.

And if he had not, why did he take her again, unleſs he gave her only as a Bait to</hi> Hortenſius, <hi>and lent her when ſhe was young, to have her again when ſhe was rich?—</hi>It's plain from this Inſtance, that <hi>Cato</hi> was guilty of countenancing Impurity in others, if he was not actually guilty of it himſelf; and ſeeing he was unwilling to take his Daughter from <hi>Bibulus,</hi> and yet as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to gratifie <hi>Hortenſius</hi> by parting with his own Wife, it would argue, that he was weary of her, and that he would make no Scruple to uſe other Women, ſeeing he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her to give up her ſelf into the Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of another Man.

            <p>We come now to treat of the Puniſhments which Divine Juſtice inflicted upon this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, which were very ſharp and ſevere, his Father and he both being diſpoil'd of that large Empire which they had erected for themſelves, out of the Ruins of that of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> the Great. His Mother and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and divers of his Wives, were made Priſoners, and he himſelf forſaken by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who had formerly ſo much ador'd him, but now made it a capital Crime for
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:110363:119"/> any body ſo much as to propoſe a Treaty or Accommodation with him; and <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> miſs'd little of having cut him off treacherouſly.</p>
            <p>It is alſo remarkable, that this luſtful Prince was puniſh'd obſervably in his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Stratonice,</hi> who follow'd her Father's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Example. The Story is well known to be as followeth. <hi>Demetrius</hi> having mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this his beautiful Daughter to <hi>Seleucus</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> to whom ſhe brought forth a little Son, <hi>Antiochus</hi> Son to <hi>Seleuchus</hi> by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Marriage, fell ſo paſſionately in love with his Step mother <hi>Stratonice,</hi> that he ſicken'd upon it, and was in danger, and not daring to diſcover the Cauſe of his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he ſaw no other Remedy for his hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Misfortune but what was to be expected from Deſpair and Death, which he therefore reſolv'd upon, by abſtaining from Diet. <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtratus</hi> the King's Phyſician quickly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd that Love was his Diſtemper, but could not at firſt diſcover the Object; he therefore diligently waited in his Chamber, and when any of the Beauties of the Court came to viſit the ſick Prince, he curiouſly obſerv'd the Emotions and Alterations in the Countenance of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and by that means diſcover'd <hi>Stratonice</hi> to be the Object of his Flames; for when ſhe came in, either with the King, or alone, <hi>Antiochus</hi> became mute, his Paſſion ſmothering his Words, a fiery Bluſh would mount into his Face, he would fix his Eyes upon <hi>Stratonice,</hi> and then preſently withdraw his ſtoln guilty Looks,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:110363:120"/> his Pulſe would be diſorder'd, a cold Sweat would ſeize upon him, and unable to ſupport the violent Paſſion, he would become ſenſleſs and pale. <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> having made this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, acquainted <hi>Seleucus,</hi> that his Son's Diſtemper was Love, but incurable, becauſe it is impoſſible for him to enjoy the Object of his Paſſion, and as impoſſible for him to live without it. The King demanding why he could not enjoy the Object, <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>Sir, becauſe he is in love with my Wife.</hi> Upon this the King expoſtulated with the Phyſician, ſaying, <hi>How, my dear</hi> Eraſiſtratus! <hi>will you not do me the Kindneſs as to beſtow your Wife upon my Son and Succeſſor, when there is no other way to ſave his Life? Nay then, Sir,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Phyſician, <hi>the Object of the Prince's Love is your own</hi> Stratonice. <hi>Ah, my dear Friend,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Seleucus, may ſome kind God or Man put the Safety of the Prince upon that Iſſue, I would part not only with</hi> Stratonice, <hi>but my Empire, upon condition that I might preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>e</hi> Antiochus. And thereupon inſtantly ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned a Council, wherein the Marriage of <hi>Antiochus</hi> with <hi>Stratonice</hi> was agreed upon: And thus <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s Daughter purſuing her Father's Example, entertain'd an unlawful Amour.</p>
            <p>Juſtice continu'd to purſue <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſo that he fell ſick at <hi>Pella</hi> of a deſperate Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the true Daughter of Intemperance and Luxury; and during this Indiſpoſition <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> took moſt part of the Kingdom of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> from him; and tho' he recover'd a great part of it afterwards, yet his Army
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:110363:120"/> deſerting him, he was quickly deſpoil'd of it again; which threw <hi>Philla,</hi> one of his Wives, into ſuch Deſpair, that ſhe poiſon'd her ſelf. After this he married <hi>Ptolemaida,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Euridice,</hi> his Wife <hi>Philla</hi>'s Siſter, ſo that tho' Judgment follow'd him now very cloſe, yet he would not be diverted from his impure Amours. His Army, with which he fought againſt <hi>Agathocles,</hi> grew not only mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous, but was grievouſly afflicted with the Plague; and he being hard preſſed upon by his Enemies, had recourſe to <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Son-in-law, who at firſt was willing to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him kindly, but being otherwiſe advis'd by his Council, he took Arms againſt him, and put him ſo to it, that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to have kill'd himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, ſurrender'd himſelf up to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who made him a Priſoner, but gave him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Entertainment. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> during this Reſtraint, gave himſelf wholly up to Intemperance, which brought Diſtempers upon him that kill'd him, and ſo he became his own Executioner.</p>
            <p>The next Inſtance which <hi>Plutarch</hi> affords us is, that famous one of <hi>Mark Antony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> He tells us, That <hi>Antony</hi> in his Youth was debauch'd by <hi>Curio,</hi> who plung'd him into all the Inconveniences of Whoring and Drinking, and a Debt of 250 Talents, which was very ſhameful in one of his years. <hi>Antony</hi> did alſo incurr the Diſpleaſure of the better ſort of People, by his Midnight Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, his wild Expences, his rouling from one little Whore to another, his Nups in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:110363:121"/> the Day, and his Walks to digeſt his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches, and then at Night again his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments and Balls for the ſolemnizing the Nuptials of ſome Comedian or Buffoon. <hi>Cytheries</hi> the She-Comedian he doted on mightily, ſo that ſhe was with him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went, and her Equipage was as ſplendid as his Mother's. He lodg'd his little Whores and ſinging Wenches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he paſs'd, in the Houſes of ſerious Men and Women, which gave great offence. But that which compleated his Ruin was, his falling in love with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> upon her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him at his Summons, for having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted <hi>Caſſius</hi> in the Wars. <hi>Dalleus,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Meſſage to her, had no ſooner ſeen her admirable Beauty, but he told her, <hi>It was impoſſible that ſo beautiful a Creature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

            <p> While <hi>Antony</hi> ſpent his time thus in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Vengeance was purſuing him apace, for News was brought him, that his Wife <hi>Fulvia</hi> and her Brother <hi>Lucius,</hi> who had for ſome time maintain'd his Quarrel againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were driven out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> had over-run a great part of <hi>Aſia.</hi> This rous'd him out of his Sleep, ſo that he ſet ſail for <hi>Italy</hi> with Two hundred Ships, and meeting ſome of his Friends by the way, they told him, That <hi>his Wife</hi> Fulvia <hi>being a Woman of an ambitious Spirit, had occaſion'd the War, being in hopes that the Commotions in</hi> Italy <hi>would force</hi> Antony <hi>from</hi> Cleopatra.

            <p>But as ſoon as <hi>Antony</hi> return'd into <hi>Syria,</hi> his unlawful Amours with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> took fire afreſh, and he preſented her with whole Kingdoms and Provinces at a time, to the great diſguſt of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and tho' he had aſſembl'd a vaſt Army, which made <hi>India</hi> tremble, and put all <hi>Aſia</hi> in a Conſternation, yet all thoſe Preparations were of no uſe to him, he was ſo much charm'd and bewitch'd

            <p>Great Military Preparations being made on both ſides, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was reſolv'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her Paramour, dreading otherwiſe that a Peace might be contriv'd by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of <hi>Octavia;</hi> and the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him, ſhe furniſh'd near a Million of Money towards carrying on the War: And ſo far was <hi>Antony</hi> tranſported with Rage againſt his Lawful Wife <hi>Octavia,</hi> that he ſent Orders to <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>ſhe ſhould remove out of his Houſe, with all her Children:</hi> And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf ſo inſolently to many Noble <hi>Romans,</hi> by <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s means, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him daily, and went over to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who did ſo much deſpiſe <hi>Antony,</hi> becauſe of his Effeminacy, that he would talk publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That</hi> Antony <hi>had drank Potions that bereft him of his Senſes;</hi> and, <hi>that his chief Counſellors were an Eunuch and</hi> Cleopatra'<hi>s Waiting-women.</hi> The Event verified, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> made a true Judgment of Things; for tho' <hi>Antony</hi> had a prodigious Force, <hi>viz.</hi> no leſs than Five hundred Galleys, moſt of them of eight and ten Banks of Oars, ſo very rich, that they ſeem'd deſign'd for a Triumph; and beſides theſe, he had One hundred thouſand Foot, and Twelve thouſand Horſe, and ſix Vaſſal-
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:110363:123"/> Kings attending him; yet he had no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to manage this mighty Force, but, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Mind of his beſt Generals, he would venture all on a Sea-battel, becauſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> deſir'd it. And this Luxurious Woman, when Fortune had not as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd it againſt him, did perfectly loſe him the Battel, by running away with ſixty Sail in the heat of the Fight; and he was ſo far beſotted with Love to her, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follow'd her, leaving his Fleet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, and his Army without a Commander, that as <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had begun his Ruin, ſhe might be ſure to accompliſh it. In a little time <hi>Antony</hi> was deſerted by all his Forces and Friends, and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and he both forc'd to ſue to <hi>Caeſar</hi> for his Favour, who would not grant her any, except ſhe put <hi>Antony</hi> to death. And thus being reduc'd to Deſpair, and purſu'd to <hi>Alexandria</hi> it ſelf, the Naval and Land-Force that was left deſerted to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which made <hi>Antony</hi> think that <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> had betray'd him; and ſhe being afraid that he might do her a Miſchief in his Rage, retir'd to a Monument which ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for her ſelf, and ſent him word, that <hi>ſhe was dead,</hi> upon which he ran himſelf into the Belly; but, before he dy'd, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had ſent to have him brought to her in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, wherein ſhe had enclos'd her ſelf with two Women only. When he was brought thither, ſhe durſt not open the Door, for fear of being taken alive and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but let down Cords, to which <hi>Antony</hi> was faſten'd, and ſhe and her two

When ſhe got him up, ſhe laid him on her Bed, tore her Hair and her Clothes, and the ſenſe of her own Misfortunes was wholly ſwallow'd up in the thoughts of his. She expreſs'd the greateſt Paſſion and Tenderneſs for him imaginable, calling him her <hi>Lord,</hi> her <hi>Husband,</hi> and her <hi>Emperor,</hi> but in a little time he died. <hi>Caeſar</hi> being inform'd of this, ſent <hi>Proculaeius</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take <hi>Cleopatra</hi> alive, if poſſible, being afraid that ſhe would otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all her vaſt Treaſures: <hi>Proculaeius</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent one to treat with her at the Door, did in the mean time get in at the Window where ſhe drew up <hi>Antony,</hi> by the help of a Scaling-ladder, and ſurpriz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d her, upon which ſhe drew a Dagger to have ſtabb'd her ſelf, but being prevented at that time, her Life was prolong'd for ſome days; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtain'd Leave of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to pay her laſt Oblations at the Tomb of the deceaſed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> ſhe lamented him in moſt pathetical and paſſionate Expreſſions, and retiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to her Monument, writ a Letter to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> deſiring that ſhe might be buried in the ſame Tomb with <hi>Antony,</hi> and ſtraitway poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd her ſelf by the bite of an Aſp, which ſhe had order'd to be brought her in a Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Figs, and ſo diſappointed <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of leading her in Triumph.

            <p>In that ſame Life we have an Account, that <hi>Clodius</hi> a noble <hi>Roman</hi> being in the vigor of his Youth, and in love with <hi>Pompeia, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s Wife, he gets privately into <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Houſe, in the Habit of a Minſtrel, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being then offering Sacrifice there, which it was not lawful for Men either to hear or ſee. <hi>Clodius</hi> being a Youth, and Beardleſs, hoped to get to <hi>Pompeia</hi> among the Women unknown, but loſing himſelf in the Paſſage of that large Houſe by Night, <hi>Aurelia,</hi> one of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Mother's Women, 'ſpying him wandring up and down, enquir'd his Name, and thus, being neceſſitated to ſpeak, he was known by his Voice; which being noiſed abroad, <hi>Caeſar</hi> put away his Wife <hi>Pompeia,</hi> and <hi>Clodius</hi> was proſecuted for prophaning the Holy Rites. <hi>Cicero,</hi> tho' his Friend, yet to preſerve his Quiet with <hi>Terentia</hi> his Wife, was forc'd to accuſe him.</p>
            <pb n="224" facs="tcp:110363:125"/>
            <p> The cauſe of <hi>Terentia</hi>'s Spite againſt <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> was upon the account of his Siſter <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> who had a mind to marry <hi>Cicero,</hi> by whom ſhe was frequently viſited, and this gave <hi>Terentia</hi> Ground of Jealouſie. <hi>Clodius</hi> was alſo accus'd of Inceſt with his own Siſters, and of deflowring ſeveral other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but the Judges being brib'd, he was acquitted. It appears alſo plainly enough, by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without Blame, as to his Chaſtity, for he put away his Wife <hi>Terentia</hi> to marry a young Virgin, as ſhe alledg'd, for the ſake of her Beauty, or as his own emancipated Slave ſaid, for her Riches, to ſatisfie his Debts. Not long after this Marriage, his Daughter <hi>Tullia</hi> died, for which he prov'd unconſolable, and put away his new-married Wife for ſeeming to rejoyce at her Death; but a further Judgment purſu'd him, for <hi>Antony</hi> bearing him an irreconcilable Hatred, ſent Aſſaſſins after him, when he fled from <hi>Rome,</hi> and murder'd him in the 64th Year of his age, his Hands and Head being cut off, and publickly affix'd to the Roſtra at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Life of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> our Author informs us, That that Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſperately in love with <hi>Atoſſa,</hi> one or his own Daughters, but concealing his Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Paſſion, for fear of his Mother <hi>Paryſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> the wicked Woman, to further ſome of her own miſchievous Deſigns, perſwaded him to marry her, contrary to the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Sages, alledging,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:110363:125"/> That <hi>he was determin'd by Providence to be a Law to the</hi> Perſians; and he is alſo accus'd by <hi>Heraclides</hi> the <hi>Cumean,</hi> and other Hiſtorians, of having likewiſe married his ſecond Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Ameſtris.</hi> The Judgments which purſu'd this laſcivious Prince were, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in his War with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and became contemptible in the Eyes of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, upon the account of his unſucceſsful Expedition againſt the <hi>Caduſians.</hi> He was alſo puniſh'd by the Controverſies amongſt his Sons about the Succeſſion, and by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and villainous Amours of his Son <hi>Ochus,</hi> with his Wife <hi>Atoſſa;</hi> therefore, to daſh the Hopes of his Son <hi>Ochus,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd <hi>Darius</hi> the elder Brother his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, who ſoon after begg'd of the King, that he would give him <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> who was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s beloved Miſs, but then Concubine to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who tho' he had Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Sixty moſt exquiſite Beauties in his Seraglio, could not endure to part with <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> to <hi>Darius;</hi> but being conſtrain'd to it by the Law, he afterwards took her from him, and created her Prieſteſs to <hi>Diana,</hi> which bound her to perpetual Chaſtity; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account the unnatural Son conſpir'd againſt his Father, at the Inſtance of <hi>Tiriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus,</hi> who bore a mortal Grudge to <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,</hi> for having married his own Daughter <hi>Ameſtris,</hi> whom he had promis'd him to Wife; but the Plot being diſcover'd, <hi>Darius</hi> was put to death, as a juſt Recompence for his unnatural Luſt and Treaſon. After this, <hi>Ochus,</hi> by his Intereſt with <hi>Atoſſa,</hi> was ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:110363:126"/> in his Hopes of Succeſſion, found Means to cut off his other two Brothers, <hi>Ariaſpes</hi> and <hi>Arſames,</hi> the Grief of which kill'd <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> And thus was he juſtly puniſh'd by and in his own Children, becauſe of his horrid Uncleanneſs, leaving his Son <hi>Ochus</hi> behind, who being the wicked Son of a wicked Parent, prov'd a Monſter of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
            <p>Thus we have finiſh'd <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s ſelect Lives, and dare referr it to the Judgment of the Ingenuous Reader, whether many of his Heroes have not been foully culpable, as to the point of Chaſtity, and as remarkably pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd for the ſame. We come, in the next place, to ſearch among the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, where we find many remarkable Inſtances for our purpoſe, and as remarkable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments purſuing 'em.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who tho' he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd over moſt part of the then known World, yet was himſelf triumph'd over by his Luſts. When he was High-Prieſt of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> he divorc'd <hi>Coſſutia,</hi> a Lady of an <hi>Eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian</hi> Family, and of a very great Fortune, to whom he had been contracted during his Minority, and married <hi>Cornelia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cinna:</hi> Nor could all the Arguments of <hi>Sylla</hi> the Dictator prevail upon him to part with her: Whereupon he was ſuſpended his Sacerdotal Dignity, and had his Eſtate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred, which forc'd him to abſcond and ſhift his Quarters almoſt every Night, tho' ſick of a Quartan Ague, and with much ado
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:110363:126"/> obtain'd his Pardon at laſt. Being thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to the Marriage-bed, he was puniſh'd in the ſame Coin; for, having afterwards married <hi>Pompeia,</hi> ſhe was accus'd of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with <hi>Clodius,</hi> as has been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, who had acceſs to her during publick Worſhip; whereupon he divorc'd her. The Laſciviouſneſs of his Mind may be alſo gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at by his Dream, <hi>that he had raviſh'd his own Mother,</hi> which tho' thoſe who pretended to interpret ſuch things told him, <hi>That it was a Preſage that he ſhould arrive at the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy,</hi> yet is a plain Indication of the predominancy of his Luſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suetonius</hi> alſo acquaints us, That he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd his Daughter <hi>Julia</hi> from <hi>Servilius Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> her former Husband, (one who had ſtuck the faſteſt to him of all Men living, in his Diſpute with <hi>Bibulus,</hi> his Fellow-Conſul) and married her to <hi>Pompey,</hi> which made him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Daughter's Adultery, and was a horrid piece of Ingratitude at the ſame time. And tho', it's true, he had great Succeſs in his War againſt the <hi>Gauls, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> yet he was not without Checks from Divine Juſtice, having loſt a whole Legion by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> had two of his Lieutenants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated on the Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> and loſt the greateſt part of his Fleet upon the Coaſts of <hi>Britain.</hi> And in his own Family he was puniſh'd, by the Death of his Mother, his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> and his Grand-daughter: Nor was he without danger of being indicted and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y'd for his Life, for his Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration during his Conſulſhip, and of being
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:110363:127"/> utterly ruin'd by <hi>Pompey,</hi> tho' he had the good Fortune to overcome him at laſt in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive Battel on the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> Plains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suetonius</hi> gives us a particular Enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Amours, which have ſpread his Infamy as far as ever his Fame reach'd: His being a <hi>Catamite,</hi> and guilty of <hi>Sodomy</hi> with <hi>Nicomedes</hi> King of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> occaſion'd many Railleries upon him, and expos'd him to the Contempt of his Enemies; as, when he ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd one day in the Senate, and ſaid, <hi>He would run down his Adverſaries;</hi> they reply'd, that <hi>He would find that an hard Task for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> alluding to his being proſtituted by <hi>Nicomedes.</hi> They call'd him alſo <hi>The Queen of</hi> Bythinia'<hi>s Cuckoldmaker, the Bawdyhouſe of</hi> Bythinia, <hi>and</hi> Nicomedes'<hi>s Stable:</hi> His Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary <hi>Bibulus</hi> ſaid of him, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd him, That <hi>formerly he affected a King, but now a Kingdom. Octavius,</hi> a prating Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, whoſe Tongue uſually got the ſtart of his Wit, did one day, before a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when he ſaluted <hi>Pompey</hi> by the Name of <hi>King,</hi> give <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Title of <hi>Queen. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> upbraided him with thoſe things in his Epiſtles; and when <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in his Plea before the Senate for <hi>Niſa</hi> Daughter to the ſaid <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes,</hi> inſiſted upon the good Offices that King had done him, <hi>Cicero</hi> cut him ſhort, ſaying, <hi>No more of that, let me beg you, Sir; we all know very well what has paſſed betwixt you two.</hi> Nay, the very Souldiers who attended his Chariot in his <hi>Gallic</hi> Triumph, amongſt other Lampoons us'd upon ſuch occaſions, had this noted Lampoon:</p>

It is alſo very well known to what Dangers his Conteſts and Wars with <hi>Pompey</hi> expos'd him, and how at laſt he was murther'd in the Senate, notwithſtanding all the Warnings he had giv'n him of the Deſign. And it deſerves a particular Remark, that <hi>Brutus,</hi> whom many ſuſpected to be his own Son, his infamous Familiarity with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being notorious, was one of thoſe that ſtabb'd him; whereupon he cried out, <hi>What, and are you one of them alſo, you my Son</hi> Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus?

            <p>The next is <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> of whom <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> gives us this following Account, That having divorc'd his Wife <hi>Scribonia,</hi> becauſe of her froward and peeviſh Humour, he fell

            <p>The next Inſtance is that of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> who, to comply with the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> divorc'd his Wife <hi>Agrippina,</hi> who had born him a Son, and was then big with Child, to marry <hi>Julia</hi> Daughter to the ſaid Emperor, much againſt his Inclination. This Marriage as it was unlawful, did juſtly prove uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, ſo that ſome time after the Death of his Son by <hi>Julia,</hi> there aroſe ſuch a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them, that from that minute he forbore the uſe of her Bed; and ſhe being convicted of Adulteries, a Divorce was drawn up againſt her in his Name, and ſent him by <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> After this <hi>Tiberius</hi> retir'd to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praea,</hi> where he gave himſelf up to Drink and Luſt, inſomuch that he was call'd <hi>Biberius,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Mero</hi> inſtead of <hi>Nero,</hi> and was waited on at Meals by Wenches. There he invented Alcoves, which he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Whores, and Catamites, and lewd Diſcoverers of unnatural and beaſtly Poſtures and Motions, and thoſe he call'd <hi>Spinctriae,</hi> the Incendiaries of his Luſt: He entertain'd himſelf by ſeeing them in three ſeveral rows abuſing each other, thereby to excite his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd Appetite. He provided likewiſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Chambers hung about with filthy Pictures and infamous Statues, and furniſh'd them with the abominable Books of <hi>Elephantis,</hi> that if any one had a mind to be prodigiouſly wicked, he might not want a Pattern to ſin by. He invented alſo in the Woods, Walks and Grottoes proper for the buſineſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,

               </gap> Nymphs and Satyrs; ſo that, in alluſion to the Iſland and his beaſtly Luſtfulneſs, he was publickly derided by the Name <hi>Caprinaeus</hi> One incredible piece of Debauchery he was guilty of, <hi>viz.</hi> that he debauch'd young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren yet in ignorance, calling them <hi>his little Fry,</hi> teaching them to play between his Thighs while he ſwam, to lick, and tongue, and ſuck him like Infants not yet weaned. It is alſo ſtoried of him, that when a piece of <hi>Parrhaſius</hi>'s Work, repreſenting <hi>Atalanta</hi> offering her Mouth in that manner to <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And one time, when he was performing Sacrifice, he was ſo ſeiz'd with a Fit of this unnatural Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards the Boy, that carried the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, that he could ſcarce reſtrain himſelf till the Sacrifice was over, and as ſoon as that was done, he debauch'd both that Boy and his Brother; and hearing that they upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another with that Ignominy after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he order'd both their Leggs to be broken.</p>
            <p>He was wont to abuſe Women, and thoſe of Quality too, very unnaturally; as was evident in the Caſe of <hi>Mallonia,</hi> who being brought him by his Panders, and reſolutely withſtanding his Brutiſh Deſires, was cited before him upon the Depoſitions of ſuborn'd
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:110363:131"/> Witneſſes, where he ask'd her openly, if ſhe did not yet repent of her coy Refuſal, and rex'd her ſo, that ſhe at laſt went out of Court and ſtabb'd her ſelf, having before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand ſufficiently reproach'd the old Goatiſh Lecher, with his naſty and obſcene Mouth, upon which, in the next Farce, a ſevere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection was made upon him which took mightily, and was in every-body's Mouth; the Expreſſion was thus: <hi>The old He-goat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Such Practiſes muſt neceſſarily be thought to render him odious, and therefore he kept in his Retirement, as not daring to venture himſelf among the People, yet Juſtice found him out; our Author gives us an Account, that <hi>Caius</hi> was ſuppos'd to have given him Poyſon, which wrought upon him by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; others ſay, that they ſtarv'd him; and ſome, that he was ſtifled with a Pillow in the 78th year of his age.</p>
            <p>The next that falls under our Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>Caligula,</hi> of whom <hi>Suetonius</hi> gives us this following Account, <hi>viz.</hi> That during his Youth he ſpent Nights in haunting Brothel-houſes, and meeting upon Adulterous Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, diſguis'd in a Perruque and a long Gown, and was moſt paſſionately addicted to Dancing, Singing, and all the Alurements of the Stage; with every one of his Siſters he was inceſtuouſly familiar, and at all his Entertainments they were placed next below him by turns, while his Wife ſate at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the Table. Among the reſt, he is reported to have debauch'd <hi>Druſilla,</hi> while
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:110363:132"/> he was yet but a Youth, and was once taken a-Bed with her by his Grandmother <hi>Antonia;</hi> ſoon after being married to <hi>Lucius Caſſius Longinus,</hi> he took her away from him by force, and liv'd with her as if ſhe had been his Wife; and, after her Death, it was his uſual Oath to ſwear by <hi>Druſilla</hi>'s Deity. As for his other Siſters, he did not love them ſo paſſionately, but did frequently proſtitute them to his Ganimedes, which afforded him a more eaſie Opportunity to condemn them in the Caſe of <hi>Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> of whom he was afraid, for Adultery.</p>
            <p>As to his Marriages, he contracted and diſſolv'd 'em with equal Ignominy. Upon the very day that <hi>Livia Oreſtilla</hi> was married to <hi>C. Piſo,</hi> he being preſent at the Wedding, commanded her to be brought home to his Palace as his own Wife, but within a few days turn'd her off again, and two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baniſh'd her, pretending that ſhe had convers'd privately with her Husband in the mean time. Others report, That being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the Nuptial Supper, as he ſate over againſt <hi>Piſo,</hi> he ſent one to whiſper in his Ear theſe words, <hi>Forbear to lie with my Wife;</hi> and preſently after riſing from the Table, led her home along with him, and next day ſet forth a Decree, declaring, That <hi>he was married according to the Example of</hi> Romulus <hi>and</hi> Auguſtus <hi>Lollia Paulina</hi> being married to a Perſon of Conſular Degree, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Army, upon hearing that her Grandmother was one of the moſt beautiful Ladies of her Time, he became ſo enamour'd
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:110363:132"/> of the Grandchild, that he ſent for her out of the Province where ſhe was, forc'd her from her Husband, took her to himſelf, and in a ſhort time likewiſe turn'd her off, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding her for ever after the knowledge of any other Man. <hi>Ceſonia,</hi> tho' neither hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom nor young, and the Mother of three Daughters by another Man, he lov'd ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately, that he would often ſhew her to his Souldiers riding by his ſide, with her Horſeman's Coat embroider'd, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtark naked to his Familiars.</p>
            <p>Being brought to want Money by thoſe his extravagant Courſes, he invented new and unheard-of Impoſts; one was, that he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from common Proſtitutes the Gratuity for one Nights Familiarity, and oblig'd mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried People alſo to pay a certain Rate for the uſe of the Marriage-bed. He built alſo a Brothel-houſe in his own Palace, with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments ſuited to the Dignity of the place for Ladies and Gentlemen to enjoy their clandeſtine Amours; and, to force a Trade, he ſent his Officers about to invite both young and old to bring their Miſtreſſes to his Conveniencies, of whom, when they came, he receiv'd his ignominious Toll, which there were Perſons ready to receive, and ſet down the Names of every Man in a Book, as Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Revenue.</p>
            <p>We come now to take notice of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which befel him: It is natural to conceive, that thoſe Debauches impair'd his Health, ſo that he never had any either in Body or Mind. It was believ'd that his Wife
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:110363:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Ceſonia</hi> had drench'd him with a Philter or Love-potion, which depriv'd him of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and almoſt made him mad, ſo that he never ſlept above three hours in a Night, and then alſo was diſturb'd with troubleſome Dreams and Viſions; at laſt becoming hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and intolerable by his Luſts and Cruelty, he was cut off by <hi>Caſſius Cheraea</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Sabinus,</hi> Tribunes, and other Conſpirators, as he was going to ſee the <hi>Pyrrhick</hi> Dances, the one giving him a mortal Wound in the Neck with his Hanger, and the other run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him quite through the Body. This vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Monſter had render'd the Name of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſo odious, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had a mind after his Death to have aboliſh'd their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and lay their Temples in Aſhes.</p>
            <p>The next Inſtance is <hi>Claudius Druſus Caeſar,</hi> whoſe Father <hi>Druſus</hi> being unlawfully begot, the luſtful Contagion was, it ſeems, by that ſame means convey'd to the Grandſon, who in his Youth kept company with none but looſe debauch'd Fellows, and follow'd their bad Example. <hi>Livia Medullina</hi> died on the very day appointed for her being married to him. His Wife <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rgulanilla</hi> he divorc'd for notorious Proſtitution, and every-body knows how unfaithful the infamous <hi>Meſſalina</hi> his Couſin-German was to him; upon which he ſolemnly declar'd, that he would for the future keep himſelf a Widower, and that he would freely forgive them, tho' they ſhould kill him, if not. Yet ſoon after he fell in Treaty with <hi>Pelina,</hi> whom he had put away before, and then with <hi>Lollia Paulina;</hi> at length he
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:110363:133"/> engag'd in an inceſtuous Amour with <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi> Daughter to his Brother <hi>Germannicus,</hi> and ſuborn'd certain perſons to move, that he might be conſtrain'd to marry <hi>Agrippina,</hi> as being the only means conducible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the Publick Tranquility, and that there might be a Toleration alſo for others to contract Marriages in the ſame degree, which till that time had always been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inceſtuous: He was ſo impatient, that he could not ſtay till the next day to prepare for his Wedding. There was none how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that follow'd his inceſtuous Example, but a certain Libertine, and a chief Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Legion, to both which Weddings he invited himſelf and his Wife <hi>Agrippina,</hi> for the encouragement of others. His Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was puniſh'd, amongſt other things, by the loſs of his Son <hi>Druſus,</hi> who having toſs'd a Pear up into the Air, and gaping to catch it again, it fell ſo exactly into his Throat, that it choaked him. He was ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted, he ſign'd Writings for the ſettlement of a Dowry upon the Contract of Marriage between his Wife <hi>Meſſalina</hi> and her Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer <hi>Silius,</hi> being made believe that 'twas only a Contrivance found out to delude the Fates themſelves, and to transfer upon the Head of another Man thoſe Diſaſters which the Predictions of the Soothſayers and ſeveral Prodigies had ſix'd upon his Perſon; and at laſt he was poiſon'd by a Muſhroom which <hi>Agrippina</hi> gave him.</p>
            <pb n="242" facs="tcp:110363:134"/>
            <p> The next Inſtance is <hi>Nero,</hi> the Son of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi> and the wicked <hi>Agrippina</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, whoſe future Miſchievous Temper his Father predicted, when the Nobility came to compliment him upon <hi>Nero</hi>'s Birth, <hi>viz. That there could nothing proceed from him and</hi> Agrippina <hi>but what was deteſtable, and would prove pernicious to the Commonwealth:</hi> Which every man who is acquainted with Hiſtory knows to have been exactly fulfill'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suetonius</hi> gives this following Account of him, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Petulancy, Luſt, Luxury, Avarice, and Cruelty he practis'd by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and at firſt conceal'd 'em under the Excuſes of Indiſcretion and Heat of Youth; but yet he could not carry it ſo, but that every-body ſaw they were rather the Vices of Nature than Age. So ſoon as it grew duskiſh, away he flew in diſguiſe to Tippling-houſes, Cooks-ſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> frolicking and ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about the Streets, beating ſuch as were going home late from Supper; ſome little Shops he would alſo break open and riſle, and afterwards ſell the Spoils. In thoſe Quarrels he ſeveral times ran the hazard of his Life, being once almoſt bruis'd to death by a Senator, whoſe Wife he would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him in the Street.</p>
            <p>Beſides a great number of Pages, whom he made uſe of in his unlawful Pleaſures, and his Contaminations of married Women, he deflower'd <hi>Rubria,</hi> one of the Veſtal Virgins, and would very fain have married <hi>Acte</hi> a Slave, ſuborning ſeveral Perſons of Conſular
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:110363:134"/> degree, to ſwear that ſhe was of Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. <hi>Sporus,</hi> a young Boy, after he had caus'd him to be gelt, he endeavour'd to have altogether transform'd into a Woman, and after he had veil'd him, married him, and ſettl'd a Dowry upon him with all the Ceremonies of a ſumptuous Wedding, he kept him at home as his Wife; upon which the Wits of thoſe times ſaid, <hi>It had been well for the World if</hi> Domitius <hi>his Father had had ſuch a Wife.</hi> This <hi>Sporus</hi> he carried about with him, in a pompous and coſtly Habit, as if he had been the Empreſs her-ſelf, under the Title of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> to all the trading Towns of <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſoon after ſhew'd him openly at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>Sigillarian</hi> Street, and would frequently kiſs him as they ſate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame Litter. He ſent for a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, who was very like his Mother <hi>Agrippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and entertain'd her among the reſt of his Concubines; and he was accus'd of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inceſt with his own Mother as often as he rode in the ſame Litter with her, which was diſcover'd by the Pollutions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear'd his Clothes.</p>
            <p>His own Chaſtity he proſtituted in ſuch a manner, that there was hardly a Member of his Body undeſil'd, inſomuch that at length he invented a new ſort of Lechery, which was, to cover himſelf all over with the Skin of ſome wild Beaſt, and ſo to be let out of a Cage, that he might fly upon the Secrets of Men and Women that were tied to a Stake; and after he had that way gratified his mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Luſt, he proſtrated his own Body to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:110363:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> his enfranchis'd Bondman <hi>Doryphorus,</hi> who had married him as he himſelf had wedded <hi>Sporus,</hi> and in that paſſive poſture counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the ſoft Cries and Complaints of a new-bedded Virgin. He was ſo very vile himſelf, that he believ'd every-body to be ſo, only that they diſſembl'd their Vices, and were private in their Debauches; and if any Man would but confeſs their Obſcenities to him, he pardon'd all the reſt of their Crimes.</p>
            <p>His impious Mother was remarkably pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the Divine Vengeance, which gave her up to the unnatural Fury of the Monſter her Son, to whom ſhe had ſo unnaturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted her Body; for after he had divers ways attempted to rid himſelf of her, but in vain, he at laſt commanded her to be kill'd, as having conſpir'd againſt his Life; which being effected, he ran with eager Curioſity to view the naked Body of his Mother, as ſhe lay weltring in her Blood, and handled all her Limbs, of which he commended ſome for their Beauty and Shape, and diſprais'd others; and happening to be thirſty in the midſt of his unnatural Survey, he was ſo little concern'd, that he quench'd his Thirſt over his murder'd Parent, who left the World with that ſevere Reproof to him, when his Murderers approach'd her, <hi>viz. That they ſhould ſtrike her Belly firſt, which had brought forth ſuch a Monſter into the World as</hi> Nero. After this barbarous and unnatural Murther, the wicked Monſter never enjoy'd Quiet, but was conſtantly purſu'd with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:110363:135"/> of Conſcience, and cry'd out, <hi>That he was haunted by his Mother's Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nero</hi> had alſo a plurality of Wives, <hi>viz. Octavia, Poppaea Sabina,</hi> and <hi>Statilia Meſſalina,</hi> having kill'd <hi>Atticus Veſtinus,</hi> the Husband of the latter, that he might enjoy her. His Wife <hi>Octavia</hi> he endeavour'd ſeveral times to have ſtrangled, and divorc'd her under pretence of Barrenneſs; but perceiving the People took her Part, he put her to death, upon a falſe Accuſation of Adulteries. He had an entire Love to his Wife <hi>Poppaea,</hi> yet kill'd her with a kick upon the Guts when ſhe was big with Child, becauſe ſhe reprov'd him for ſtaying too late at his Chariot dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Exerciſes. He put <hi>Antonia,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Claudius,</hi> to death, for refuſing to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him after the death of <hi>Poppaea.</hi> He alſo murder'd <hi>Aulus Plantius,</hi> a young Gentleman, whoſe Body he had forcibly defil'd before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and after he had kill'd him, uſed this tannting Expreſſion, <hi>Now let my Mother go and kiſs my Succeſſor,</hi> giving it out, <hi>That he was his Mother's Gallant, and by her ſpurr'd on to lay Claim to the Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This villainous Monſter having wallow'd a long time in unnatural Luſts and cruel Murders, became hateful to every one. He ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on fire with his own Hands, which was a juſt Judgment of God upon that City, for ſuffering it ſelf to be ſet on fire by his raging Luſts: After that, they were viſited with a Peſtilence, which cut off many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of 'em. His Souldiers in two of the chief <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Garriſons were maſſacred, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:110363:136"/> many of the <hi>Romans</hi> and their Allies were ſlaughter'd in other places of that Iſland. His Legions in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> had the Ignominy of being put under the Yoke; and all <hi>Syria</hi> was like to be loſt, ſo cloſely did Vengeance pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him. Then <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> revolted, under the Conduct of <hi>Galba</hi> and <hi>Vindex,</hi> which ſo ſtruck him, tho' he ſeem'd little concern'd at his former Diſaſters, that he ſank down, and for a long time lay Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, like one that had neither Life nor Soul, and when he came to himſelf, he fell a tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Clothes, thump'd himſelf about the Head, and at length cried out, that <hi>he was undone:</hi> But being at laſt convinc'd of the neceſſity of making head againſt his Enemies, his firſt Care was, to provide Waggons to carry his Scenical M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>chines and Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and to have his Concubines, which he deſign'd to carry with him, trim'd with their Hair cut like Men, and arm'd with Battel-axes and ſmall round Targets, after the manner of Amazons, ſo far was he judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially given up to his Luſts.</p>
            <p>In the mean time he was terrified with frightful Dreams and dreadful Omens, ſuch as that he was dragg'd into hideous Darkneſs by his Wife <hi>Octavia,</hi> and that his Body was cover'd with a multitude of winged Emmets; the Doors of the <hi>Mauſolenm</hi> flew open of their own accord, and a Voice was heard from thence, ſummoning him diſtinctly by his Name. It was alſo obſerv'd, that the laſt Tragedy which he acted in publick was <hi>Oedipus</hi> exil'd, which concluded in theſe
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:110363:136"/> Words, that were very applicable to him, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Then, upon freſh Intelligence that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were revolted, he tore the Letters as he ſate at Dinner, overturn'd the Table, call'd for a Doſe of Poiſon, and retir'd into the <hi>Servilian</hi> Gardens, where he tormented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with perplexing Thoughts what to do in this Diſtreſs; ſometimes he thought of throwing himſelf at the Feet of <hi>Galba,</hi> or to implore the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Parthians;</hi> and ſometimes he thought of putting himſelf in Mourning, humbling himſelf to the People, and begging their Pardon before the Roſtra, but from that was deterr'd, fearing he ſhould be torn in pieces before he got to the Forum; ſo waving the matter till next day, he wak'd about Midnight, and then finding his Guards drawn off, he leap'd out of his Bed, and ſent up and down for his Friends, but none of them coming to him, he went himſelf, with ſome few Attendants, to their Houſes, where meeting with no admittance, he return'd to his Chamber, from whence by that time the few of his Guards that remain'd had alſo march'd off, having firſt rifled his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and carried off, amongſt other things, his Gold Box with the Doſe of Poiſon in it; which put him into that Deſpair, that he ſent for any of the publick Executioners to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch him, and none of them being to be

But this luſtful and luxurious Emperor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming hateful to every body, he was every where either vanquiſh'd or betray'd, and at laſt ſeiz'd in the Porter's Lodge of his own Palace, whence he was dragg'd ignominiouſly through the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>As for the Emperor <hi>Titus,</hi> and his Son <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> they were not without Blame as to the Point of Chaſtity, and tho' their Exits were not tragical, like thoſe of the preceding Monſters, yet they were not without their Troubles and Reproaches, as juſt Puniſhments for their inordinate Paſſions. <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſays of <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> That he had a great number of Concubines after the death of <hi>Coenis,</hi> one of which lay by him all the while of his Repoſe. And, that being perſecuted by a certain Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſan, who pretended to be ready to die for Love of him, he at length yielded to her Embraces, and gave her Four hundred Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterces out of his own private Purſe, which he order'd his Steward to place to his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thus, <hi>viz.

He died of a ſudden Looſeneſs, as a juſt Puniſhment for his looſe Life, of which the indelible Stain is convey'd to Poſterity by <hi>Suetonius</hi> and other Hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>His Son <hi>Veſpatian</hi> is accus'd of ſitting up till midnight revelling with the lewdeſt of his Companions, and that his Lechery was
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:110363:140"/> notorious, by his Gangs of Catamites and Eunuchs, and the exceſſive Love he bore to the Queen <hi>Berenice:</hi> Upon the whole, he was generally eſteem'd and talk'd of as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nero;</hi> but after he came to the Empire, he reform'd himſelf, turn'd off his Paramour <hi>Berenice,</hi> and all his Catamites, and became one of the moſt excellent Princes that ever ſway'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Scepter: Yet ſo far hath the Divine Juſtice puniſh'd his Incontinence, that the Infamy of it is tranſmitted to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon Record, and he was cut off in a manner in the Vigor of his Age, being but in his 41ſt Year when he died: And of this Misfortune he was very ſenſible, the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian telling us, that he look'd up toward Heaven, bitterly complaining, that his Life was wrongfully taken from him, for he had been guilty of no Action of which he need repent, excepting one only, which what it was he neither then declar'd himſelf, nor could it be eaſily gueſs'd by any one elſe, tho' ſome were of Opinion, that 'twas his Familiarity with his Brother's Wife <hi>Domitia,</hi> but ſhe ſwore poſitively there was no ſuch thing, and ſhe would not have denied it had it been true, but rather have gloried in it; which it was uſual for her to do of any kind of Lewdneſs. But thus his Memory and Fame juſtly ſuffers, becauſe of his former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.</p>
            <p>The following Inſtance is that of <hi>Domitian,</hi> who was infamous from his very Youth; <hi>Nero</hi> produc'd a Note under his Hand when he was a young Man, wherein he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:110363:141"/> him a Nights Lodging at any time: and he is alſo accus'd of having proſtituted his Body to <hi>Nerva</hi> He divorc'd his Wife <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitia,</hi> on pretence that ſhe was in Love with one <hi>Paris,</hi> a Stage-player, and afterwards took her again. Being greatly addicted to Venery, he call'd frequent Coition his <hi>Bed-wreſtling,</hi> as if it had been a kind of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; and it is reported of him, that he would often ſmooth and depilate his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, and ſwim amongſt the moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Harlots. When his Brother's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was offer'd him in Marriage, he would by no means accept of her, as being engag'd in Wedlock with <hi>Domitilla;</hi> but not long after, when ſhe was married to another, he debauch'd her of his own accord, tho' <hi>Titus</hi> was then alive; but when her Father and Husband were dead, he lov'd her with a moſt paſſionate Affection, which he own'd before all the World, inſomuch that after he had got her with Child, he forc'd her to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, which was the occaſion of her death. This vile Prince being juſtly hated for his Cruelty and Debauchery, was kill'd in his own Chamber, by thoſe that conſpir'd againſt him, <hi>Stephanus, Domitilla's</hi> Steward, having ſtabb'd him with a Dagger in the Groin, as he was reading a Paper which he had given him, pretending it was a Diſcovery of a new Plot. And the Memory of this Emperor was ſo execrable to the Senate, that they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd all his Decrees and Titles to be every where ras'd out, and the very Memory of him utterly aboliſh'd; ſo infallibly true hath
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:110363:141"/> it always been found, that <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will puniſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have gone through ſuch Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> afford us, and muſt now have recourſe to other Authors for the remainder of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors.</p>

His two Coachmen were his chief Companions and fellow-Debauchees. He cut off abundance of the Senators, becauſe they would not allow of a Senate of Women, whereof his Mother was to be Preſident, and to determine all Female Controverſies.

               <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> his Paramour, perceiving his Jealouſie of her, inſomuch that he would neither eat nor drink without his Taſter, ſhe deſign'd to make Sport of his needleſs Fear; and therefore cauſing a Chappelet or Garland of Flowers to be made for <hi>Antony,</hi> ſhe dipp'd all the edges of the Flowers in ſtrong Poyſon; and having thus prepar'd it, ſet it upon <hi>Antony</hi>'s Head; and having ſate at Meat a good while, and drank themſelves merry, ſhe challeng'd <hi>Antony</hi> for each of them to drink their Chappelets; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt drank off her own, <hi>Antony</hi> minc'd his, and putting it into his Cup, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to drink it off; but juſt as he was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to his Head, ſhe put her Hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween and ſtaid him, and then utter'd theſe Expreſſions: <hi>My dear and beſt-beloved</hi> Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>now ſee what ſhe is whom thou doſt ſo much dread and ſtand in fear of, that for thy ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thou muſt have extraordinary Taſters, a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity more nice than needful: Lo, how I am not
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:110363:149"/> to ſeek of Means and Opportunities to compaſs thy Death, if I could find in my Heart to live without thee.</hi> And then ſhe ſent for a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner out of the Jayl, whom ſhe caus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to drink off the Cup that <hi>Antony</hi> had prepar'd for himſelf, and the poor Wretch died by that time he had well taken the Cup from his Lips.</p>
            <p>The next Inſtance is this: <hi>Cleopatra</hi> being poſſeſs'd of two Pearls, the richeſt and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that were ever known in the World, being left to her by deſcent, and accounted Nature's Wonder, ſhe began to undervalue the Expence that <hi>Antony</hi> had been at in treating her from day to day, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his might; and when he demanded of her how it was poſſible to go beyond the magnificence and coſt of his Treat, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That <hi>ſhe would ſpend upon him One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Seſtertii at one Supper. Antony</hi> thought that impoſſible, and therefore wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd with her, that ſhe could not do it. Next night ſhe made him a Supper, royal enough, but much ſhort of thoſe that he had before prepar'd for her; whereupon he began to laugh her to Scorn, and demanded a Bill of the Particulars, to which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That <hi>what had been brought in alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was meer Overplus, and that ſhe would yet in that Supper eat Six hundred thouſand Seſtertii for her own part:</hi> Upon which ſhe took one of thoſe Pearls from her Ears, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in Vinegar, drank it off: And as ſhe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:110363:149"/> was about to do the like with the other, <hi>L. Placentius,</hi> the Judge of that Wager, laid faſt hold upon it, and pronounced, That <hi>Antony</hi> had loſt; upon which he fell into a mighty Paſſion. There was an end of one Pearl; and the fellow thereof being taken from this Queen when ſhe was a Priſoner, it was divided in two, in memory of that half Supper of theirs, and hung in the Ears of <hi>Venus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Pantheon.</hi> And yet, ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> as prodigal as they were, they ſhall not go away with the Prize; for long before their time <hi>Clodius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeſop</hi> the Tragedian practis'd the like in Pearls of great price; ſo that <hi>Antony</hi> hath, to match him in all his Magnificence, one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better than a Stageplayer.</p>
            <p>Leſt Drunkenneſs ſhould be thought to be only the Vice of ſome particular perſons among the <hi>Romans, Lipſius</hi> in his Epiſtles tells us, That it was a common Crime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, becauſe the Emperors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were deeply infected with it, and highly rewarded it in others. He names one <hi>Firmus,</hi> who was Deputy of <hi>Egypt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and drank off two Buckets full of Wine at a time. <hi>Bonoſus</hi> the Emperor was wont to ſay, That <hi>he was not born to live, but to drink;</hi> and when he was hang'd for ſome Miſdemeanour, he was call'd <hi>an hanging Tankard,</hi> and not a Man. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Maximinus</hi> is charg'd with drinking nine Gallons of Wine in one day. And
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:110363:150"/> one <hi>Phagon,</hi> in <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s time, is accus'd of drinking more; inſomuch that <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſays, He ſhould tremble to write thoſe things, but that he had them from good Authors. <hi>Nero</hi> promoted <hi>Piſo</hi> to be Provoſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> for his Drunkenneſs; and <hi>Flaccus Pomponius</hi> to be Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> for that ſame Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. He likewiſe prefer'd an ignoble and obſcure Fellow before the Chief of the Nobility, to be a Queſtor or Treaſurer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he drank off nine Gallons of Wine at a Feaſt which <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf had made. And how far that beaſtly Vice of Drunkenneſs had infected the common People of <hi>Rome,</hi> appears by the <hi>Fannian</hi> Law, ſays <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Saturnal, lib.</hi> 3, <hi>c.</hi> 17, which was made againſt Drunkenneſs, becauſe, ſays he, matters were come to that paſs, that the greateſt part of the common People of <hi>Rome</hi> came ordinarily drunk into the Council-houſe, to conſult of the Safety of the State.</p>
            <p>The more to excite them to Drunkenneſs, the Veſſels out of which they drank were very coſtly and curious in their Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, being chas'd, emboſs'd, or wrought in Imagery and Flowerwork, as if the Painter had drawn them. Theſe Celatures were ſo fram'd, that they might put them on or take them off at pleaſure, and were therefore call'd <hi>Emblemata:</hi> Such was that whereof <hi>Javenal</hi> the Satyriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Sat.</hi> 1, <hi>Stantem extra pocula Caprum;</hi> a Goat ſtanding out from the Cup; two of this kind coſt <hi>Lucius
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:110363:150"/> Craſſus</hi> the Oratour One hundred thouſand Seſterces, that is about Five hundred thirty three Pounds Sterlin. Sometimes they were made of Onix-ſtones, dug from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſometimes of Mother of Pearl, and other curious Shells; and all thoſe kinds they richly enamel'd with Pearls and precious Stones. We drink, ſaith <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 33. 11, in rows of Pearl, and garniſh our Pots with Emeralds; it delights us to hold the <hi>Indies</hi> in our Hands, as a provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Drunkenneſs. And becauſe of the richneſs of their Cups, they ſet ſome at their Feaſts to watch their Drinking-veſſel. They thought not themſelves dainty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, ſaith <hi>Pacatus,</hi> unleſs Luxury had chang'd the Seaſon of the Year, unleſs Winter-roſes ſwam upon the top of their Pots, and unleſs their pleaſant Wines diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd the Summer-ice in a large Gemm. They had alſo Cups of Murrin and Cryſtal of wonderful great prizes, and one of thoſe bought for Three hundred thouſand Seſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or above Five and twenty hundred Pounds Sterlin, by <hi>Nero, Petronius,</hi> who had been Conſul, broke in pieces a little before his death, on a ſpight to <hi>Nero,</hi> that he might diſinherit his Table thereof.</p>
            <p>We ſhall conclude this point of their Drunkenneſs with the beaſtly Forms of many of their Cups; <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:110363:151"/> ſaith, <hi>In poculis libidines caelare Juvat, &amp; per obſcaenitates bibere: They delight to engrave their Luſtful Dalliances upon their Cups, and to drink in Obſcenity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that falls under our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is their Gluttony, which being alſo a Sin of the Fleſh, and an Incentive of Luſt and Uncleanneſs, does properly belong to our Subject.</p>
            <p>Their Luxury in this reſpect appear'd in their Tables, Platters, Number and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Servants, as well as in their Courts. They had Tables of Silver and Gold, as appears by that of <hi>Martial, Epig.</hi> 31: <hi>Suſtentatque tuas Aurea menſa dapes;</hi> i. e. <hi>Thy Diſhes are ſet upon Tables of Gold:</hi> But the Tables which they valued moſt were of Citron, which they brought from <hi>Africa. Tully</hi> had one which coſt him Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Seſterces, tho' he was both ſevere in his Morals, and poor, compar'd with others. <hi>Afinius Pollio</hi> had one which was ſold for Eleven thouſand Seſterces; and the more knotty thoſe Tables were, the more they were valued. And thoſe Tables ſtood alſo upon Ivory Frames and Feet. <hi>Dion</hi> reports of <hi>Seneca,</hi> That notwithſtanding his ſevere and Stoical Profeſſion, he was ſtor'd with Four hundred ſuch Tables; and <hi>Annius</hi> had three hundred of them, and as many Servants to attend them.</p>
            <pb n="277" facs="tcp:110363:151"/>
            <p> Then as to their Platters or Chargers, <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, That <hi>Druſillanus,</hi> one of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Slaves, and his Treaſurer in <hi>High Spain,</hi> had a Silver Charger of Five hundred pound weight; and <hi>Vitellius</hi> had one which coſt him a Million of Seſterces, or about Eight thouſand Three hundred and Thirty three pounds Sterlin; ſo that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus</hi> upbraided the Memorial of him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Exceſs that way <hi>Palinarum Paludes, Platters as broad as Ponds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then as to their Waiters at Table, they ſometimes made uſe of naked Wenches: And thus <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor ſent a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>Sextus Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dius,</hi> that he would come and ſup with him, on condition that he would change nothing of his wonted faſhion, which was, that he ſhould have naked Wenches waiting on him at Supper. <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his 95th Epiſtle, ſaith, they had whole Troops of unfortunate Ganimedes, and Troops of exſolete or ſtale Catamites grown to Man's eſtate, waiting on them at Table, and thoſe they rank'd into ſeveral Bands, according to their Nations and Complexions. He further tells us of the infinite number of their Cooks, Bakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then cries out, <hi>Dii boni quantum hominum unius Venter exercet! Good God, what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men doth one Belly ſet at work!</hi> They had alſo Schools, and Maſters to teach the Art of Carving to their Scholars, by
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:110363:152"/> Diſhes faſhion'd in Wood after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and with what geſture of the Body they ſhould cut them up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his 97th Epiſtle, ſays, <q>Do you wonder that our Diſeaſes are innumerable? Number our Cooks if you can. The Schools of Philoſophers are empty, but how are our Kitchins frequented?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 9. 17, ſays, That ſcarce any Man was in greater requeſt than thoſe Cooks that could moſt artificially waſte their Maſter's Subſtance. The infinite waſte they made this way, the only Story of <hi>Api<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> an infamous Belly-God, may ſuffice to ſhew, who having laid up Ninety Millions of Seſterces for his Kitchin, beſides many great Gifts of Princes, and a mighty Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the Capitol, being deep in Debt, he began at laſt, tho' ſore againſt his Will, to look into his Reckonings, and ſound that, all being caſt up, he had ſtill remaining clear Ten Millions of Seſterces, or Eighty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>three thouſand Three hundred and thirty pounds Sterlin; and yet, for fear that he ſhould live in an Hunger-ſtarv'd faſhion, he poiſon'd himſelf: Upon which <hi>Seneca</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims, <q>How great was that Luxury to which ten Millions of Seſterces ſeem'd Poverty?</q>

            <pb n="279" facs="tcp:110363:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> And that this Gluttony was common among the <hi>Romans,</hi> appears from <hi>Juvenal</hi> and <hi>Seneca;</hi> the former, <hi>Sat.</hi> 1, ſays, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na comedunt patrimonia menſa; They devour whole Eſtates at one ſitting:</hi> And the latter, <hi>Ep.</hi> 95, ſays, <q>What is more lewd than a ſumptuous Supper, that waſtes a Knight's Revenues, of which the moſt frugal, if it be but any way ſolemn, coſts Three hundred thouſand Seſterces, or Two thouſand Five hundred and Fifty five pounds Sterling?</q> Nor did they only exceed as to the Quantity and Quality, but as to the Frequency of their Banquets. <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſpent a Night and two days in continual eating and drinking. It was uſual with <hi>Nero</hi> to eat from Noon till Midnight; and <hi>Vitellius</hi> feaſted uſually three or four times a Day, every ſitting being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at Four hundred thouſand Seſterces, or Thirty-three thouſand Three hundred and thirty-three pounds Sterling; which was One million Thirty-three thouſand Three hundred and thirty-two pounds Sterling <hi>per</hi> Day; being eaſily able to go through them all by a continual Cuſtom of Vomiting, which was common among them: Says <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, De Conſolatione ad Albinam, c.</hi> 9. <q>They vomit that they may eat, and eat again that they may vomit; and thoſe Delicates which they hunt for through the World, they vouchſafe not ſo much as to digeſt:</q> Nay, the very Women practiſe it as well as Men; they eat againſt their Stomachs that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:110363:153"/> which they ſoon return by their Mouths. The number of their Courſes were uſually ſeven; and at one Feaſt that Monſter <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus</hi> had two and twenty Courſes of the choiceſt Fare ſerv'd in. Nay, <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us, That at a caſual Supper made to the Emperor <hi>Vitellius,</hi> by his Brother, there were Two thouſand of the choiceſt Fiſh, and Seven thouſand Fowl, ſerv'd in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca,</hi> in the above-cited place, ſays, They fetch that from the furtheſt part of the Ocean which their Stomachs, weaken'd with Delicacies, will hardly admit. And then a little after he adds; <q>O wretched Men, ſays he, whoſe Pallates are not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but with precious Meats, eſpecially when that which makes them be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precious is not their ſingular Reliſh or excellent Savour, but only their Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and the Difficulty of procuring them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Latinus Pacatus,</hi> in his Panegyrick ſays much the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> That this our World was too narrow for their Throats; for, not valuing their Cates by their Taſt, but by their Coſt, they were only content with that Proviſion which they had from the uttermoſt parts of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or <hi>Colchus,</hi> ſeated beyond the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <q> Many think it (ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Book concerning the Precepts of Health)
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:110363:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> an abſurd thing not to feed liberally on things which are rare, and can hardly be got, ſuch as the Paps of a Sow when ſhe is newly farrow'd, <hi>Italian</hi> Muſhromes, <hi>Samian</hi> Cakes, or Snow out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Among theſe Exceſſes, <hi>Vitellius</hi>'s Platter deſerves our notice, which, for the bigneſs of it, he call'd <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Buckler; and this he cramm'd with the Livers of Guiltheads, the Brains of Pheſants and Peacocks, the Tongues of Phaenicopters, and the Melts of Lampreys, brought from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Carpathian</hi> Seas.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:110363:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> delighted ſo much in his Lampreys, that he gave each of 'em a Name, and they would come to him one by one upon his Call. <hi>Antonia,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Druſus,</hi> hung Jewels in the Gilds of a Lamprey which ſhe lov'd; and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the Orator wept for the death of one of his Lampreys.</p>

            <p>Their prodigious ſuperfluity in their tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porary Buildings, and ſuch as were only deſign'd for pleaſure, was no leſs abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, fetching Marble from the remoteſt parts of the Earth, hewing down the top<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Mountains, and tranſporting them by <hi>Sea,</hi> at the expence of many Mens Lives.</p>
            <p>Of this nature was the Theatre of <hi>Scau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> which was capable of receiving Eighty thouſand perſons to ſit at their caſe; the Stage of it had three Stories, wherein were Three hundred and ſixty Columns of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the nethermoſt part of the Stage was
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:110363:155"/> of Marble, the middle of Glaſs, and the uppermoſt of gilded Boards; the Columns beneath were thirty-eight foot high, and between them there ſtood three thouſand Statues and Images of Braſs. The Hangings of this Theatre were of Cloth of Gold; and they had painted Tables, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that could be found: And yet, ſays <hi>Pliny,</hi> this Theatre was not to continue above a Month.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame nature was <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Bridge, mention'd by <hi>Suetonius,</hi> built from <hi>Puteoli</hi> to <hi>Bauly,</hi> over a Bay of the Sea, for no other uſe but Oſtentation, and that he might imitate <hi>Xerxes;</hi> and upon this he marched with the Senate and Souldiery, in a triumphant manner, feaſted and paſſed the Night in Dalliance and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>Then, as to their permanent Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatres, <hi>Ammianus</hi> gives us this Account of that built by <hi>Titus, viz.</hi> the heighth thereof was ſuch, that the Eye of Man could hardly reach it. It was rear'd, ſaith <hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> with Rivers of Treaſure poured out: It contain'd upon the very Steps of it eaſie Seats for Eighty-ſeven thouſand Men; and, in other places, room for Twenty thouſand more.</p>
            <pb n="286" facs="tcp:110363:156"/>
            <p> And as the maſs of Treaſure was inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite which they caſt away in the raiſing of theſe Buildings, only to make People ſport, it was incredible what they ſpent in furniſhing them, and ſetting forth their Games therein. <q>They ſpent in exhibiting Sword-fights, ſaith <hi>Lactantius,</hi> Treaſure enough to maintain great Cities. And the Magiſtrate, upon Theatrical Games, ſays <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in his 81ſt Sermon, laviſhes out his whole Patrimony to purchaſe one hour's Applauſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Furniture of thoſe Theatres was ſometimes all of Silver, as that of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Caius Antonius,</hi> and ſometimes of Gold. And thus <hi>Nero,</hi> for the Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Greatneſs to <hi>Teredates</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> cover'd over not the Stage only, but the whole Theatre, with Gold. The Curtains which kept them from the heat of the Sun was all of Purple, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with Stars of Gold, and the place below, call'd <hi>Arena,</hi> becauſe ſtrow'd with Sand, <hi>Nero</hi> cauſed to be ſtrow'd over with Duſt of Gold, he himſelf being to try a Match of Chariot-driving therein.</p>
            <p>Their incredible Expence and Luxury in abuſing the Creature at thoſe Shows, meerly out of a Principle of Pride and Oſtentation, will yet further appear by the Inſtances fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <pb n="287" facs="tcp:110363:156"/>
            <p> They were at a vaſt Expence in the multitude of Fencers, whom they hir'd for great prices, becauſe they were to expoſe their Lives, beſides the Charge of their Arms and Diet before they enter'd: And when they exhibited Beaſts, the Relations made by Hiſtorians concerning their number are incredible.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> tells us, That the Emperor <hi>Probus</hi> commanded to be let looſe at once a thouſand Oſtriches, a thouſand Staggs, a thouſand wild Boars, and a thouſand fallow Deer, beſides wild Goats, wild Sheep, and other Beaſts, all which he gave over to the Mercy, or rather to the Rage, of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, every one to catch what he could, the <hi>Circus</hi> at the ſame time being ſet all over with tall and mighty Trees, which the Souldiers took up by the Roots in the Wood, brought them thither, and faſten'd them with green Turf, and Bars, and Irons. The next day he let into the ſame place an hundred creſted Lions, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leopards of <hi>Lybia,</hi> an hundred of <hi>Syria,</hi> an hundred Lioneſſes, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Bears; which filled the Air with Roaring, as if it had been with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Madneſs of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was yet greater, who exhibited Ships in the <hi>Circus</hi> failing and fighting in Wine.</p>
            <pb n="288" facs="tcp:110363:157"/>
            <p> And, during thoſe Shows, it was uſual to refreſh the Spectators with pleaſant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, ſweet Water, Oyntments, Saffron mixed with Wine, or ſomewhat of that kind, which they convey'd in cloſe Pipes through the whole Amphitheatre. And the Fight being ended, they commonly caſt a Largeſs among the People, wrapping up the Names of thoſe things in little pellets, which they intended to give, and every one, as he could catch them, brought them to the Maſter of the Games, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd them the things themſelves ſpecified in the Pellet; and thoſe Gifts conſiſted not only in Meat, Drink, and Apparel, but in Veſſels of Silver and Gold, Horſes, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, Slaves, and the like. And <hi>Nero</hi> added curious Pictures, precious Stones, yea, Ships, Horſes, Farms, Iſlands; A thing hardly to be credited, ſays <hi>Lypſius,</hi> though deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by <hi>Suetonius,</hi> a moſt faithful Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</p>
            <p>Their Luxury did likewiſe extend it ſelf to their Baths, which ſome of them had ſo accuſtom'd themſelves unto, that they could neither eat nor drink without bathing firſt, or being ſweated in a Stove. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, That the number of them at <hi>Rome,</hi> in his time, was infinite; that <hi>Agrippa,</hi> during his Aedileſhip, built for publick uſe One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy; And ſome of them, ſays <hi>Ammianus,</hi> were ſo large, that they were
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:110363:157"/> built in the manner of <hi>Provinces. Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>'s Baths alone were ſo capacious, that they contain'd, for the uſe of Waſhing, Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred ſeveral Seats, and thoſe all of poliſh'd Marble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his 86th Epiſtle, hath moſt elegantly expreſs'd, and bitterly cenſur'd the Ornament and Beauty of thoſe bathing places, thoſe of the Common People ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Walls ſhining with great and precious Circles, and the Shavings of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midian</hi> Marble, inlaid with that of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> their Borders painted or inlaid with diverſe Colours, their Arched Roofs cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with Glaſs, and the whole adorn'd with <hi>Thaſian</hi> Stone, formerly a rare Sight but in Temples; and the Water was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into them by Silver Cocks. But how much beyond all this, ſays he, are the Baths of their Freed-men? how many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Pillars have you there, for no other uſe, but only for Ornament and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> goes farther, and tells us, That not only the ſides of the Ciſterns in which they bathed were of Silver, but the Seats and Footing for the Bottom, ſo as they could hardly ſtand for ſliding upon it. Nay, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinus,</hi> in his <hi>Roman Antiquities,</hi> ſays, They us'd to anoint the very Walls of their Baths with rich Oyntments, even ſuch as were but for the uſe of Servants.</p>
            <pb n="290" facs="tcp:110363:158"/>
            <p> Another piece of their Vanity and Pride of Life was the infinite numbers of charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Statues that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> erected to themſelves, and thoſe for the moſt part overlaid with Gold. This itching Humour of theirs to eternize themſelves, as they thought they would do by this means, did in time beget almoſt as many Inhabitants to the City as Nature brought forth; ſays <hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> They were ſo numerous, that they fill'd every Corner, peſter'd their Streets, and ſtreighten'd their Ways; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that an Edict was publiſh'd in the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> forbiddimg any private Men to erect Statues to themſelves, but by Leave firſt obtain'd from the Senate. The baſeſt of thoſe Statues were made of Marble, the reſt of Ivory, and Silver and Gold, and thoſe alſo ſolid and maſſy. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> would ſuffer no Statues to be erected for himſelf in the Capitol, but of maſſy Gold, and weighing no leſs than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound. And <hi>Commodus</hi> had one of a thouſand pound weight.</p>
            <p>They were alſo at great charge in guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Statues, and to this purpoſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an Officer of great Honour, who had the Title of <hi>Comes Romanus;</hi> his province was to walk through the Streets of the City in the Night-time, with his Souldiers, chiefly to take care that no Wrong ſhould be offer'd to the Statues; ſo prodigally
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:110363:158"/> careful were the <hi>Romans</hi> of their own Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and at the ſame time prodigally care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the Lives of others.</p>
            <p>We come next to take notice of their prodigality and ſumptuouſneſs in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Buildings. The elegant Poet <hi>Claudian</hi> ſpeaking of them in general, ſays,</p>

                  </gap>ro</hi> alone had eighteen great Houſes in the Country fit to be Palaces for Kings: Their Houſes were ſo exceſſive large, that a Man would wonder what uſe they could be of; and therefore <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi> upbraids one of them, who thought he was ſtraiten'd in his Dwelling, thus, <hi>whoſe Houſe is no larger than were all</hi> Cincinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus'<hi>s Grounds.</hi> Some of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Slaves had Kitchins which took up above two Acres of Ground; and the Lands of thoſe who laid the Foundation of the Empire were of leſs extent than the Cellars of ſome that came after. <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſays, Their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Farms were built in the manner of Cities. Nay, <hi>Seneca, de Benef.</hi> 7. 10, ſays, that private Men's Houſes exceeded the largeneſs of great Cities. And <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Sat.</hi> 14, ſays, ſome of them exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their chiefeſt Temples, and the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol it ſelf, in heighth; and upon the tops
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:110363:159"/> of thoſe high Houſes they planted Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Orchards, and Groves.</p>
            <p>Their Riches and Ornament were ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Greatneſs, for they brought the moſt skilful Architects from all the known parts of the World, whoſe Wit and Boldneſs was ſuch, that they attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to effect what Nature ſeem'd to deny. <hi>Lucullus</hi> caus'd Mountains to be cut, to let the Sea into a Pleaſure-houſe of his near <hi>Naples,</hi> for the conveniency of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fiſh, and for that ſame purpoſe built Rooms in the Sea.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other Ornaments for their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they delighted chiefly in Pillars or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of great heighth, and ſometimes two hundred in number in one Gallery or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They guilded the very Beams, Roofs, and Walls of their Chambers with Pictures and precious Stones intermingled; and they ſo fram'd the movable Roofs of their Dining-rooms, that they could change them upon the bringing in of every new Courſe to the Table: And ſometimes they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Groves, with Birds ſinging in them. And anſwerable to theſe Roofs were their Pavements; whereupon <hi>Martial</hi> reprehends them for treading upon Onyx-ſtones.</p>
            <pb n="293" facs="tcp:110363:159"/>
            <p> We ſhall conclude this point with a ſhort Account of the Houſes of <hi>Domitian, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Domitian</hi>'s, <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays thus of it; <q>If any Man wonder at the Magnificence of the Capitol, were he in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Palace, and ſaw but one Gallery, Hall, Bath, or Parlour for his Concubines, he would preſently cry out with <hi>Epichar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> That all the Glory of the Capitol is but a Trifle, in compariſon of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s own Houſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Nero</hi>'s, <hi>Suetonius</hi> deſcribes it thus: <q>In the Porch there was a <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> ſhap'd like himſelf, One hundred and twenty foot high; the Houſe had three Galleries in it, each of them a Mile long; a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pool, like a Sea, ſurrounded with Buildings in manner of a City; Fields, in which were Arable Grounds, Paſtures, Vineyards, and Woods, with a multitude of tame and wild Beaſts of all kinds. In the other parts thereof all was cover'd with Gold, and ſhining with precious Stones, or Mother of Pearl. The Dining-rooms were Roofed with Ivory Planks, that were movable for the caſting down of Flowers, and had Pipes in them for the ſprinkling of Oyntments. The Roof of the principal Dining-room was round, and wheel'd about Day and Night, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:110363:160"/> to the Motion of the Heavens. And when he had thus finiſh'd this Houſe, he ſaid, <hi>He began to dwell like a Man.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Then as to <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives an Account, <q>That he built of Cedar many Barges, whoſe Sterns were ſet with Pearls and precious Stones; they carried Sails of diverſe colours, and had in them Baths, Galleries, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of great largeneſs, with variety of Vines, and Trees bearing Fruit; and lying along in thoſe, in the midſt of his Muſick, he was carried up and down the Coaſt of <hi>Campania.</hi> In the building of his Country-houſes he ſet aſide all Reaſon, and deſir'd nothing ſo much, as that which was told him could not be done; ſo that he would order huge Piles to be laid in the Sea, to ſtop the courſe of it, cut through Rocks of the hardeſt Flint, raiſe the Plains as high as the Mountains, and level the Mountains with the Plains.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing we take notice of is their Exceſs in Houſhold-ſtuff. Their Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteads by degrees came to be of Silver, then guilded, and at laſt of maſſy Gold, Nay, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had his Cloſeſtools and Chamberpots of the ſame; and 'twas ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for them to have their Beds per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd with rich and precious Odours
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:110363:160"/> Then for the Ornament of their Houſes, they bought them Pictures at exceſſive rates: <hi>Lucius Lucullus</hi> gave for the Copy of <hi>Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera</hi> with a Chappelet of Flowers in her Hand, two Talents or Three hundred and eighty Pounds Sterling. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor gave for a Picture of the <hi>Argonauts</hi> One hundred forty four thouſand Seſterces, or Twelve hundred pounds Sterling; of which <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays wittily thus: <hi>What diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there herein betwixt us and Children, who value counterſeit Rings, and Jewels, and Bracelets at high prices, ſave that we dote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Statues and Pictures, playing the fool at a dearer rate?</hi> Then the Workmanſhip of thoſe Pictures was many times laſcivious and beaſtly, and full of obſcene poſtures, enough to corrupt the chaſte Minds of the beholders.</p>
            <p>Their Luxury in Apparel, Dreſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was equal to their Luxury in all other things. Concerning their Effeminacy in general, <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <q>What is yet left of Good manners or Faſhions we extinguiſh by trimming and decking our Bodies; We have exceeded the Niceneſs of the Women, and wear light and whoriſh Colours, not becoming Matrons; We faſhion our Gate to a wanton and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing pace, and do not walk, but creep: It is now held the accompliſh'd Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of our Youth to frizzle their Hair like Women, to ſpeak with an affected
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:110363:161"/> ſmallneſs of Voice, in tenderneſs of Body to match them, and to bedeck them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with moſt undecent Trimming.</q> In his Book <hi>De brevitate Vitae,</hi> he ſays, How do they chafe if the Barber be never ſo little negligent! How do they take on if any thing be lopp'd off of their Foretops, if any thing lie out of order, if every thing fall not even into their Rings and Curls, which of theſe would not chuſe, that the State whereof he is a Member ſhould be in Combuſtion, rather than his Hair ſhould be diſplaited. It was common for them to have their Hair plaited behind, and beſmear'd with Oyntments and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes; and for their Faces they us'd ſo much Slibber-ſauce, ſuch daubing and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that they look'd like Ulcers. Their Garments were artificially preſs'd, to make them ſhine brighter, and ſo curiouſly plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the Orator commenced a Suit againſt his fellow in Office, for that meeting him by chance in a narrow way, he had diſorder'd the Plaits of his Robe; he held it a capital matter, that a Fold upon his Shoulder was diſplac'd: And ſo exceſſive they were in the multitude of their Apparel, that when any of them went to the publick Baths, they had as much Apparel carried after them as might well ſuffice a dozen of Men. <hi>Lucullus,</hi> ſays <hi>Horace, Ep.</hi> 6 had Five thouſand ſhort Cloaks; and at their publick Feaſts they chang'd Suits at the coming in of every
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:110363:161"/> Courſe, meerly for Oſtentation; as we have ſhew'd already.</p>
            <p>It was alſo uſual with them to have Rings on every Finger, and ſometimes one for every Joynt. Nay, 'tis recorded of <hi>Charinus,</hi> that he wore ſix upon every Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and they arriv'd to that heighth of Luxury in this point, that they had Summer-rings and Winter-rings.</p>
            <p>Then as to their Women: If the Men were ſo nice, we may well ſuppoſe that their Women exceeded, concerning whom <hi>Seneca, de Benef.</hi> 7. 9, ſays, 'I ſee their Silken Apparel, if it may be call'd Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, wherewith they can neither cover their Bodies nor their Shame, which when a Woman wears, ſhe cannot ſafely ſwear that ſhe is not naked. Yet theſe things are brought from Nations with whom we have no Traffick, that our Women may expoſe no leſs to the publick view when they come abroad, than they do to their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in Bed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lollia Paulina,</hi> a Wife, and afterwards Widow to <hi>Calîgula</hi> the Emperor, when ſhe went to any ordinary Feaſt, us'd to have ſo many Jewels about her, that ſhe ſhone again as ſhe went, and offer'd to prove, that thoſe Ornaments alone ſtood her in Four hundred thouſand Seſterces.</p>
            <pb n="298" facs="tcp:110363:162"/>

Nay, one Pearl bought by <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> for his Paramour <hi>Servilia,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Brutus,</hi> coſt him Sixty hundred thouſand Seſterces, or near Forty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds Sterling. <q>Nay, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> the Women had not ſufficiently brought the Men into ſubjection, if they did not hang two or three Patrimonies at each Ear.</q> 
               <hi>Propertius</hi> accuſes the <hi>Roman</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of jetting it about with the Eſtates of their Heirs upon them: Yet all this had been more tolerable, had they not worn them upon their Feet, of which <hi>Pliny</hi> can hardly ſpeak with Patience. <hi>Lib.</hi> 33. 3, <q>Let our Women, ſaith he, wear their Pearl and precious Stones upon every Finger, about their Necks, in their Ears, upon their Chappelets and Treſſes, but muſt they alſo wear them upon their Feet? And <hi>Book</hi> 9. 35, he ſays, Nay, they garniſh their Feet with them, and not only the higher, but the lower part of their Slippers, ſo that it is not held ſufficient to wear Pearl, unleſs we tread and walk upon it.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="299" facs="tcp:110363:162"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Lampridius</hi> tells us of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> that he wore Jewels curiouſly engraven on his Feet, as if the Gravings of famous Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men could be diſcern'd there.</p>
            <p>Their Women did not bluſh to own, that they painted their Eyebrows and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and dy'd their Hair, and had ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinite numbers of little Boxes full of Traſh for hiding their Deformities, that <hi>Ovid,</hi> as great an Admirer of the fair Sex as he was, ſays, <hi>Non ſemel hic ſtomacho nauſea facta meo;</hi> i. e. <hi>They had oftentimes turn'd his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Looking-glaſſes were in heighth and breadth anſwerable to their Bodies, engraven in their Borders with Gold and Silver, and emboſs'd with precious Stone; <q>Some of thoſe, ſays <hi>Seneca, Nat. Quaeſt. lib.</hi> 1. 17, coſt more than the Ancients gave in Dowry with their Daughters; nay, than that which by publick allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was given the Daughters of the poorer Emperors.</q> And a little further he ſays, <q>Now a days, ſays he, that Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which the People of <hi>Rome</hi> gave with <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Daughter, will not ſuffice to buy a Glaſs for a Manumited Slave's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that was Eleven thouſand Aſſes, which was upwards of Forty pound Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; ſo that by this we may gueſs what Luxury reign'd among Perſons of Quality.</q>

            <p> Then as to the number of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they were ſo numerous, that <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> ſays, ſome of them had above Twenty thouſand.</p>

               <hi>Marcellinus</hi> deſcribes their Order of rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Servants when they went abroad, as if it had been an Army, inſomuch that they were under a neceſſity of having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptrollers, or Nomenclators, to tell them the Names of their Servants.

            <p>Thus we have finiſh'd our Collections from the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, which are ſufficient to demonſtrate, that that great Empire was ruin'd by Luxury and Uncleanneſs, and will ſerve to convince any judicious Reader what Monſters particular Men, and whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, become when judicially given up of God to work all manner of Uncleanneſs with Greedineſs.</p>
            <p>We come in the next place to ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> to ſee what we can find for our purpoſe there. In the 2d Book of <hi>Euſebius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The next Inſtance is in <hi>Book</hi> 3, <hi>Cap.</hi> 28, of the Heretick <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> of whom he ſays, That being a Lover of his Body, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether carnally minded, he earneſtly luſted after thoſe things wherein he dreamt the Kingdom of Chriſt conſiſted, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety of the Belly, and of thoſe parts beneath the Belly, that is, Meats, Drinks, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.

            <p>
               <hi>Book</hi> 14, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7, he gives us an account of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who boaſted of their amorous Potions, and of certain Spirits and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, maintain'd, that they who would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to Perfection in their Myſteries, muſt act all things that were moſt filthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, being no other ways able to avoid the Rulers of the World, as they call them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they diſtributed to all of them their Dues by moſt filthy and deteſtable Acts of Obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which brought a Scandal on the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe Times, as if they had indulg'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in promiſcuous Uncleanneſs with their Mothers and Siſters; but the Truth and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Doctrin and Practice did quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vindicate it ſelf from thoſe Calumnies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Book</hi> 6, <hi>Cap.</hi> 8, he gives us an account of <hi>Origen</hi>'s emaſculating himſelf upon his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe words of our Saviour in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe, <hi>viz. Some there are who have made themſelves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heavens ſake.</hi> This ſhews how much Fornication and Uncleanneſs was condem'd by the Chriſtians in his time, and how careful he was to avoid
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:110363:164"/> giving any occaſion of Slander to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Chriſtian Religion, tho' this Act in it ſelf was no way juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Book</hi> 7, <hi>Cap.</hi> 30, he gives us an Account, that <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> who ſpoke againſt the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt, and became a Founder of that Hereſie, was a ſenſual Man, countenanc'd thoſe call'd <hi>Subintroduc'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who were neither Wives nor Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, but a third ſort, whom they kept, as they pretended, not to gratifie their Luſts, but out of a pious deſign: And they take particular notice, that this <hi>Paul</hi> glutted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all Senſual Delights, as Feaſting, Drinking, and the like, which are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Incentives of Luſt, and that he carried two beautiful Women conſtantly along with him. And thus he is accus'd by an Aſſembly of Biſhops, in their Letter to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which confirms the Obſervation we have had ſometimes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make, that a Love to Senſual Pleaſures ſeems to be a great Motive to the <hi>Deiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> of our Times to embrace thoſe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſies.</p>
            <p>In his 8th <hi>Book</hi> we have an Account, That a Gentlewoman at <hi>Antioch</hi> and two beautiful Virgins her Daughters, threw themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a River, where they were drown'd, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they would ſubmit to the Brutiſh Luſts of their Heathen Perſecuters. And in <hi>Cap.</hi> 14, of that ſame Book, we have a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:110363:165"/> how <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and other Perſecuters of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> omitted no manner of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was impure and libidinous; they committed Adulteries and Rapes of all ſorts; he parted Husbands, by Divorce, from their lawful Wives, and when he had defil'd them he moſt diſhonourably ſent them back again to their Husbands. And thus he treated Perſons of all Qualities. He paſſed through no City in his Journey without raviſhing Women and Virgins; and theſe his vile Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes ſucceeded according to his deſire againſt all Perſons, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> only excepted, who having contemn'd Death, deſpis'd his outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Tyranny. And thus one of the moſt noted Women of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſon, and ſollicited to commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with him, choſe rather to expoſe her Life to Danger, and ſo was ſent into Exile: And a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, whoſe Husband was Prefect of <hi>Rome,</hi> being ſent for by <hi>Maxentius,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be defil'd by him, and finding that her Husband had, for fear, permitted the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to carry her away, ſhe kill'd her ſelf, rather than ſhe would be defil'd by the luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tyrant. So that to the ſhame of many who call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now-adays, their abominable Lecheries were formerly the Character of their Perſecuters; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more odious to the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than ſuch vile Practiſes, as many who bear that Name do now indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in. But to return to this Monſter of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:110363:165"/> Tyranny <hi>Maxentius,</hi> the Divine Vengeance purſu'd him; for, his Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Euſebius</hi> alſo takes notice, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were at that time puniſh'd with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Wars, Famine, and Peſtilence, on the account of their Perſecution and thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Practiſes; and, that <hi>Galerius Maximia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who to his Perſecution of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had alſo added Impurity of Life, died of a moſt dreadful Diſtemper in his Genitals, and a <hi>Fiſtula in Ano,</hi> to the Horrour and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that were about him, the ſtink of his Body being ſo intolerable, that it kill'd divers of his Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>In his 10th Book, he gives us an Account of the wicked Emperor <hi>Licinius,</hi> who to his hatred of the Chriſtian Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all ſorts, join'd abominable Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, forcing Wives from their Husbands, and giving them to be defil'd by his Slaves. Nay, his own Luſtful Rage was ſo great, that his decrepit Years could not aſſwage the ſame, but even then he abus'd married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Virgins, towards the fulfilling of his inſatiable Luſt; at laſt Judgment purſu'd
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:110363:166"/> him; for being overcome by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and continuing unreclaimable, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Clemency us'd towards him by that gracious Chriſtian Emperor, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to be ſtrangl'd: And thus was his Exit ſuitable to his inglorious Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates, lib.</hi> 5, <hi>cap</hi> 18, gives us an Account, That the Heathen <hi>Romans</hi> had Victualling-houſes under Ground, wherein they proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Whores, by which Devices they tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pann'd many perſons, ſome going in thither to ſupply themſelves with Food, others to ſatisfie their libidinous and filthy Deſires, for by a certain Engine purpoſely made for that end, they were convey'd from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualling-houſe down into the Bakehouſe, where they were forc'd to work, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there till they were grown old, and being never ſuffer'd to go out, their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons took it for granted that they were dead. This Trick was chiefly put upon Strangers, and was diſcover'd by one of the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s Souldiers, who being trappan'd in this manner, kill'd ſome of thoſe with his Dagger that would have detain'd him; and eſcaping by this means, acquainted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror with it, who order'd thoſe Houſes to be pull'd down, and the Maſters of them to be puniſh'd. Another abominable Cuſtom they had, which was aboliſh'd alſo by this Emperor, of which he gives the following Account: If a Woman were taken in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, they ſhut her up in a narrow Brothel-
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:110363:166"/> houſe, and forc'd her to play the Whore in a moſt impudent manner; and during the performance of that unclean Act, they caus'd little Bells to be rung, to the end that what was done within might be known to thoſe who paſſed by; of which the Emperor <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> being inform'd, he order'd thoſe Stews to be pull'd down, and commanded, that Women taken in Adultery ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe puniſh'd. It's true that <hi>Valeſius,</hi> in his Notes upon this Paſſage, thinks that this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was diſcontinu'd long before, Adultery being puniſh'd by the <hi>Romans</hi> as a capital Crime, after <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Reign, and ſays, that they were common Proſtitutes, who rung Bells to invite Paſſengers in to them; and quotes <hi>Dio Caſſius,</hi> ſpeaking of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> thus: <hi>Having made a Cell within the Palace, he acted his Lechery therein, ſtanding naked before the Door thereof, as Whores uſually do, ſhaking his Shirt, which was hung up with Golden Rings, and with a ſoft, delicate, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Voice inviting his Companions to him.</hi> So that, be how it will, it's plain that thoſe abominable things were practis'd by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and the Houſes or Vaults (whence the word <hi>Fornication</hi> is deriv'd) where they acted thoſe Impurities were deſtroy'd by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; whereas ſo many of thoſe who call themſelves by that venerable Name, in our Days, frequent ſuch loathſom and execrable Houſes.</p>

            <p>Theſe Courſes did quickly render <hi>Zeno</hi> odious in the ſight of all Men; whereupon <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> improving the general Hatred
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:110363:167" rendition="simple:additions"/> againſt <hi>Zeno,</hi> uſurp'd the Imperial Diadem, and dethron'd him: It's true, that <hi>Zeno</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reobtain'd his Crown, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited the good Chriſtian; but perſiſting however in his Impurities and Drunkenneſs, which threw him into an Epilepſie or Falling-ſickneſs, he was miſerably buried by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes Order, (ſays <hi>Baronius)</hi> in one of thoſe Fits; and when he recover'd in his Grave, and cried to the Souldiers to take him out, they anſwer'd, <hi>That there was another choſen in his room;</hi> whereupon he intreated to be taken out, and ſuffer'd at leaſt to end his days in a Monaſtery; but this was alſo denied him, and in this miſerable condition he end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wretched Life, while the Souldiers in the mean time did barbarouſly ſcoff at him. This Method did his Empreſs <hi>Ariadne</hi> take to be reveng'd on him for having defil'd her Bed, which tho' it cannot be juſtified in her, yet muſt certainly be juſtified, as coming from the Hand of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Evagrius, Book</hi> 3, <hi>Cap.</hi> 39, gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a wicked Tax, that had continued a long time among the <hi>Romans,</hi> call'd <hi>Chryſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrum,</hi> which was impos'd upon thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who proſtituted themſelves, and alſo upon Catamites, inſomuch that this Tax, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Law, made loud Proclamation, That <hi>thoſe who had a mind, might ſecurely, and with Impunity, commit ſuch abominable Lechery;</hi> which the good Emperor <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> thought ſo diſgraceful to a Chriſtian Empire, that he
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:110363:168"/> not only aboliſh'd the ſaid Tax, but burnt all the Records concerning it, and the Papers which contain'd the Methods of collecting it, that none of his Succeſſors might renew the Infamy of this Exaction.</p>
            <p>Having thus taken a ſhort view of what is to be found ſuitable to our purpoſe in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories of <hi>Euſebius, Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Evagrius,</hi> we ſhall conclude this part with ſome account of the Pennance which the Ancients injoin'd upon <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> The time of Pennance for <hi>Fornication</hi> was Seven Years, and for <hi>Adultery</hi> Fifteen. The Penitents preſented themſelves before the Door of the Church, in poor, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, and ragged Apparel; being enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, they receiv'd Aſhes upon their Heads and Hair-Cloth upon their Bodies, and then went out of the Church, the Door being uſually ſhut after them. It was cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary for them to remain ſhut up weeping and groaning, unleſs on Feſtival days, when they preſented themſelves in the Church Porch; ſome time after they were admitted to hear the Lectures, with command to go out before Prayers. At the end of a certain time they were allow'd to pray with the Congregation, but lying all-along upon the Earth, and at length, were ſuffer'd to pray ſtanding, until the Offertory, when they went out: The ſpace of time was often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg'd by the Clergy, according as they
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:110363:168"/> perceiv'd the Penitents deſerv'd Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee what an odious Sin Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was reckon'd amongſt the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> thought that there was no Mercy nor Repentance for them that were guilty of Uncleanneſs above once or twice.
